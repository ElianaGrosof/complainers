0,i8sq1q,Fed up with everything around me.,"Tomorrow I start my senior year of hs, however it’s come to my knowledge and quite possibly has been ignored by me for the last few years that I have no true friends. My mother who has made my life a living hell since I was about 14 acts like it never happened and my dad and stepmom give more positive attention other places than me. Just about the only good thing going on rn is my gf. Ik she cares and potentially loves me, however I’ve never been shown what it’s like to be truly loved and cared for so what do I know? Idk. I guess I’m just confused and upset that things don’t go how I want them. Hopefully by next week I’m out of this spell and I can finally be at peace again. Thanks.",1597290050.0,1
1,i8sisu,Legal vaping age 21,"I can get shot between the eyes on a battlefield, I can hurl myself down a road in a metal death machine that kills more people than most things, I can live on my own and pay for my own apartment/house, yet I can’t vape, something that is without a shadow of a doubt harmless. You know how they came up with 21, a politician raised it to 19 from 18 during scare campaigns for cigarettes and alcohol, boosting their ratings. And then another politician raised it to 20 to help there ratings and etc... the reason why they raised it isn’t because it helps, its because they realized that parents of 19-21 year olds were worried about their kids doing these things so they knew that those people would vote for them if they raised it. And then for some reason they just transferred the vaping age from 18 straight to 21 because we have made 21 a buzzword for politicians. It has had a negative affect, people who were smokers that were 18-20 had a reason to switch to vaping instead of smoking because they could do it legally, but now they have one less reason to quit illegally buying cigarettes from the same source instead of having to find a new illegal source to get vaping supplies. It just makes me sad that most of our laws are created out of fear mongering to improve someones career. I say it should be one or the other, make the military 21+ to join or lower the vaping age (which will never happen people are too scared to leave their little safety bubble) ive been going to catholic school my whole life and I’m decently polite, my parents still think im an angel, wake up your child isn’t perfect, either roll with the punches and improve their capabilities or waste all your time and money trying to eliminate our faults that in the end can never be gone.",1597289205.0,5

4,i8ep02,I hate booters on xbox so much and I cant even complain right because I dont know how to post on reddit.,"It started with me trying to play rainbow on xbox and I was playing with two random people I found off of a group post. Everything was going fine until we got in a game in which a random teammate was booting enemy team members which really makes me upset . I tell the dude that he should stop and that what he's doing is illegal but he just told me "" what are you gonna do cry yourself to sleep about it"", that already had me pissed off but then you add in my teammates backing up the booter that made me super upset. My teammates end up kicking me after we win the game(by cheating) and I decide to go to the unethical pro life tips subreddit to ask what I could do about it. In the post I tell the story and I say that it's a felony to boot people and that I want something to happen to them because it seems like they always get away with that. Fast forward 5 minutes and I have a couple of replies asking how it was a felony and I explained why it was, one guy told me that depending on my location it could or could not be a felony and i wrote back that whether it is or it isnt i still want something to happen because at the end of the day booting is wrong. Another person commented that I was getting on the subreddit to bitch about a game and my post was downvoted a lot, this is only my second time posting and that was my first time so it makes sense that I am using it wrong but I feel like nobody was paying attention to what I said and they played more attention to if booting is a felony, the point of the post was asking if I could do anything to the people that do this but it felt like nobody paid attention to that, i could report them to the FBI because what they are doing is serious but idk I'm just kinda let down right now.

6,i848c7,Me complaining about my awful fucking night. Enjoy!,"A Storie of an awful night. (TRUE)


So the stars of the show are,

OP: Me (F,14)
BM: Bitchy Mom (F,43)
DD: Dumb Dad (M,44)
CS: Crazy Sister (F,11)
SD: My Service Dog (M,7) (I have Tourette’s Syndrome, it’s where in my case I have uncontrollable movement and speech.  For example I’ll just clap or punch the ground, that’s a motor tic.  Or maybe I’ll scream something.  That’s a vocal tic.  The Tourette’s effects me in a way so that I need a service dog.  Any other questions google will hopefully help you out.  If that doesn’t work I’m happy to help!)
OD: Other Dog (F,7)

BTW, I just wanna say I love my family very much and they love me.  I just need to let off some steam.

On with the story!

So, me and my family were eating dinner in are living room and watching a movie called Rudy. (It’s very good!  Watch it!)

While I was eating with my back against the couch, OD comes over and tries to eat my food.  I stop her with my legs so OD’s shoulders are stuck between my thighs.  I start moving my legs left to right to try and get OD to back out but OD’s persistent and just stays there while she goes side to side.

CS suddenly yells, “OMG!  Stop killing the dog!”.
I’m very confused cause I never expected CS to ever say that even though she is CS.  Also, dose it look like I’m killing OD?  No, OD’s neck isn’t stuck between my legs and she’s only being moved enough to get annoyed.

I say, “CS, OD’s fine calm down.”.

CS’s not convinced.

BM backs me up with, “Calm down CS, OP’s not hurting the dog.”

CS surrenders.  “Just get OD out of OP’s legs!”.

I get OD away from me and my dinner and CS calms down and we continue with the movie.  This didn’t really piss me off it was just surprised CS would think i’ed hurt OD.

Later in the movie, I stretch my arms up cause I’m getting tired and I accidentally nock the lamp shade off the lamp.

BM probably had a bad day I’m guessing cause of her reaction.

“OP THIS IS THE LAST FUCKING TIME TODAY!”  I haven’t been in the room all day, and haven’t touched that lamp.

BM goes for me, she try’s to grabbed me or hit me.  I block BM by grabbing her hand like we’re gonna arm wrestle.  BM try’s to get her hand out of my hand while yelling at me, standing over me, and putting half of her weight on me other half on the couch, other hand holding the lamp shade.

BM finally gets her hand out and gives me a weaker smack then what I was guessing she was gonna give.  “What’s next!  You going to break one of my aunts old mirrors like CS or one of her lamps like this one?!”  I haven’t Brocken any of BM’s aunt’s things yet, my sister did on accident though.  Didn’t even break this lamp.

I just leave the couch and sit with SD in a chair on the other side of the room.  Honestly, that was really uncalled for.

The last thing that happened was this.  CS forgot her phone in our basement and doesn’t like to go down there at night, lights on or off cause she’s scared The Ring Girl will crawl out off the T.V. and kill her.  She hasn’t even seen the movie.

So, I go down with CS and wait in the door way of the basement.  “OP just come inside with me please!”.  I go inside and wait, I’m still next to the door way pretty much in the same spot but this is good enough for her so CS goes on her quest to find her missing phone before the infamous Ring Girl gets her.

CS finds it in like 10 seconds and we leave the basement together.  So while going up the stairs I go to fast and she screams.  (Keep in mind right now it’s like 12AM and my parents are trying to sleep.  I also go way faster cause I’m 5’10” and like 75% legs.).

When we get to the top of the stairs DD storms out of his room and grabs me and hits my arm.  Then, the same to CS.

I am pissed off now.  DD only gets this mad when he has a reason too.  This was totally unexpected and he had no reason, nothing at all.  DD also rarely to almost never hits me or CS, ever.

I go up to him and say what’s on my mind, “You has absolutely no right to do that, I didn’t do anything and CS got spook once.  That was no reason to hit us at all!”  I could tell he really regrets what he did.  I walk past him, get SD and go to bed.

5 mins latter DD opens my door and apologized.
I forgave him cause he really meant it.

Thank you for reading this all the way!  Have a great day!",1597194320.0,6

8,i7x3wc,Feminists,"Now, there are 2 types of feminists, the good kind and the bad kind. The good kind is where they want equality for both genders, which is good and should happen. But by definition, it is someone who is active in feminism, so just because you support the good feminism, doesn’t mean you are a feminist. Moving on to the bad feminists. These feminists believe that all men are horrible and should either die, or see how it feels when they are “oppressed”. These ones are the following: Hypocrites, aggressive towards men, are assholes in general, and whenever a man is mad at them, they call them sexist and use that as an excuse for them being assholes. The last reason I said isn‘t just feminists but also any people that aren’t straight white males. If you don’t like a gay person because they were bullying a kid, they’ll call you homophobic. If you don’t like a black person for attempting to steal your package at the door, they’ll call you racist. They list goes on, but I just wanted to say, the bad feminists, they are annoying.

9,i7wnss,USPS LIES ABOUT DELIVERING PACKAGES AND WON'T EVEN LET ME POST IN THE SUBREDDIT ABOUT IT. INSTEAD THEY TAKE IT DOWN.," I was supposed to get three packages yesterday and they weren't delivered, YET online in the tracking updates it says DELIVERED. But it's impossible for me to have missed the items being delivered for several reasons.

First off, my mail man usually delivers the packages first and if he/she doesn't then they come back. Well, about 4 hours before the delivered time on the tracking I got my mail which meant the packages would come later. So guess what. I checked every 1/2 to 1 hr for the packages. NOTHING!

During the time that the tracking says the packages were delivered there was absolutely no video footage - I have a motion detector camera that records whenever ANYONE comes to the front door. And the tracking said IN/NEAR mailbox.

Secondly, during that time, my brother was actually outside on the porch, he wouldn't have missed packages being brought or set outside.

Thirdly, my sister came to visit my mom about 10 minutes after SAID DELIVERY TIME, she would have brought the packages inside or seen the mailman, NOTHING

Fourth, a few minutes after my sister had left, about 30 minutes after SAID DELIVERY TIME, I checked the mail box and around it, still NOTHING.

So there wasn't any way someone could steal them within the 4 hours before SAID DELIVERY TIME or up to 1 hour after SAID DELIVERY TIME.

I even checked about 4 HOURS after SAID DELIVERY TIME for packages around or In my mail box. NOTHING was delivered, therefore,

CONCLUSION = USPS MAIL MAN/WOMAN LIED ABOUT DELIVERY TIME OR STOLE MY PACKAGES.",1597168984.0,8
10,i7k9ha,I really hate when people (on Reddit) say “Roll Tide” whenever a reference to incest is made.,"I’ve been a college football fan for a long time, and this trend just bothers me for a few reasons.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about, the University of Alabama has the nickname Crimson Tide. The phrase “Roll Tide” is like a chant/cheer they say at games. People always make jokes about Alabama people being inbred, so it became that people somehow started saying “Roll Tide” whenever incest is mentioned.

I’m no U of A fan, but it really takes a phrase meant to encourage one of the country’s sports programs and ties it to incest. It’s also annoying because:

1. It’s a pretty offensive generalization of Alabama’s people.
2. It’s such a stretch. It’s like people know two things about the whole state: football and incest. They just use one to refer to the other and think themselves clever.

Does anyone actually find this clever or funny?",1597116588.0,2

13,i7b6um,"Good Bye Guitar Center, Hello Sweetwater","There may not be enough space in this box to explain the absolute disgust, hurt, uncertainty, I left the Guitar Center Berklee Store, 159 Massachusetts Avenue, with on Friday August 7, 2020 after being told ""I'm a fucking asshole,"" and, ""to get out of my fucking store"" by a Store Manager, #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” who wasn't provoked in any way by me calling him names or even swearing at him. 

After talking this over with my girlfriend, many friends, current Employees of Guitar Center, family members (My Girlfriend was present with me and had to see another man, Store Manager # 121934 --whom was in a position of power--completely abuse it...only later to find out it was because he probably wasn't knowledgeable in Pro Audio)

My concerns are more than severe with Guitar Center as a company because Store Manager #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” who is a leader at Guitar Center is not leading by a positive example and finds it ok to swear in front of women, my lady. I really need someone to reach out to me directly so I can discuss the actions of not just an employee of Guitar Center, but upper management at Guitar Center. 

I cannot express the hurt I felt leaving the store as a longtime loyal customer of Guitar Center. You may check look into my history to see that you are the first place i bought my DAW, Reason ...which kicked off my music production career. This purchase was made at Boylston where I've been taken care of like a KING. Always respected, name always remembered. My gear setup at home -always remembered. Personal catered service. Truly the best from James Castle, Hatch, Matt at GC on Boylston ST. in Boston. Those guys…Men, are absolutely amazing. 

The actions of one employee has made me feel completely done with this company. #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” at Boyslton St completely stripped me of my respect in public by saying these words to me. And when I’d finally cooled down, I’d kept wondering what his issue was.

How it went down...briefly

I'd called the store earlier that day inquiring about an interface to suit my needs at my home studio. I wasn't sure what I'd needed, but after a little research I'd realized The Focusrite 8i6 was a good choice. My home store didn't have it which is Guitar Center /Hatch's spot on Boylston St….so I checked and realized Berklee had it. \* Mind you I’ve NEVER even entered this store because of all the bad reviews I'd heard from EMPLOYEES of Guitar Center (over the last decade) at Boylston St.  Said employees are all not with the company - but it was enough to stay away even in 2020. 

To confirm this, I was told that Berklee Employees of Guitar Center are not being paid commission - so they come to work for nothing and the energy showed on Friday August 7, 2020. IF I’m wrong – prove me otherwise but these thoughts all factored in to my current feeling in the moment on Friday August 7, 2020. All of this continues to make sense with the attitude and vibe in the store when I'd entered. It was very dark and gloomy and there wasn't music playing at any audible enjoyable level. I didn't feel like I was in a Guitar Center. I felt like i was in a pawn shop honestly. 

I was very excited to get this device because I’d thought I’d finally found a device that could not only connect my studio monitors, but allow any device routed in the Tv above my Main UW Display to play through my LSR308s (purchased through you with your warranty). which the thought of Mario sounding like COD...I'm drooling.

I’d already hyped ( understatement) my girlfriend up telling her we’d now be able to play her Nintendo Switch at the same Bass levels as some of my bassiest tracks. She was sold. 

I’m sure now you can imagine her disdain after her FIRST experience in a Guitar Center. My girlfriend had recently overheard conversations with James in Pro Audio at my home store and heard how pleasant, polite, humble, knowledgeable and passionate about his job...the type that doesn't lie about knowing some shit...and will say let me get back to you....actually do it with a answer --- and was terrified at the response I’d received when arriving to 121934’s “f\*\*cking store” 

Speaking to #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” on the phone earlier that day, August 7, 2020 at 12:41 PM (6 minute call)  I explained to that’d I’d purchased a Focusrite Solo 3rd Generation and two sets of XLR to XLR cables at Guitar Center on Boylston St Thursday August 6, 2020 and only because I’d had someone jumped in my Lyft and the driver didn’t notice for a ten minutes! I couldn’t cancel my ride or contact support as I was technically in the car. This mishap was going to have me be late to arrive at the store before close.

I knew that the Boylston Location didn’t have any device above a Solo from an earlier call with J in Pro Audio.  I couldn’t reach #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” all day due to no one answering the phone. I had an upcoming session and needed anything I could possibly acquire to record one person’s vocals over an already finished track so I went with the Solo to be safe and planned to grab the 8i6 the next day. 

I called basically at open of business at Boylston to ensure I got this device that day. I knew when I’d explained my upgrade to James, he’d move mountains to ensure I had what I was looking for. 

I’m tired of writing at this point. Someone of importance should really reach out to me as i start my social media campaign in this boring location.

IF you watch your cameras, you will see me go ask another customer (thee ONLY other customer besides my girlfriend and I) if this guy was normally like this. Watch the mans hand motion. If you need an explanation of what he meant when he rubbed his hand to show there was something to do with my treatment as it relates to my skin color. This can and will be substantiated when he told me the next device that’d allow my tv to be hooked up, etc.…was 3000 dollars. I’m sure Tobias heard this one. Ask him, simply – without insinuating where you are going…did#121934’s “f\*\*cking store” offer me a device that was 3000? Even if he lies, or forgets…but if he does confirm…this is #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” way of dismissing my pending questions about the device I was preparing myself to purchase by offering me a product 2600 dollars more than the current device i was purchasing. 

It comes to be that the question I was trying to ask him would be satisfied if I was sold the 18i8. I need the connection from my TV to My interface. And with the new Focusrite Control  I'd be able to switch between configs.

There’s never been a time in my life more than that Friday August 8, 2020 where I just wanted to drop the item I’d had and go elsewhere…but it sucked…because if I did leave I’d be pissed already and now on top of that wouldn’t be able to make music for that entire day or until I figured something else out finding a new compatible device with 2hrs before COVID closes the stores early for the evening. 

Like isn’t Guitar Center supposed to enable me to make music. I’ve purchased almost EVERYTHING I won to make music from you digitally and physicaly. My initial License for Reason. Maybe two Upgrades to that. Definitely my Reason 11. I just grabbed a MPK261, Omnisphere. All of my audio, from the interfaces to the speakers, to all of the cables and wiring are from Guitar Center. 

We got a Gear Card the beginning of this year and paid it off in full and on time for my MPK261 /Reason 11 Purchase. That's  $620ish for you readers! I leave not only Google Reviews, but Guitar Center Reviews, in store /personal reviews.. to ensure the good employees are looked after in a dying age in Retail.

The worst part is. I was trying to be a member of the Guitar Center Family pre COVID 19, And this can and should be verified with your HR. This is crazy. I can’t believe this happened. I’m so off. I haven’t even made music since Friday. I feel this interface is cursed.

 locked the purchase so I wasn’t even able to return the device. I didn’t feel he deserved credit for the sale as all he did was carry the device. I was very adamant to 095100 James Castles Manager, Hatch, that he 10000% receive credit for the sale of the device. We weren’t able to do this due something #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” did in the transaction. 

Immediately after this happened and I’d finally exited the store – I’d already called a Lyft to transport my GF and I to the Boylston St Guitar Center. 

I’ve spent over 250 dollars in Ubers/Lyfts. I’ve Lost multiple days with money waiting on return of money form purchases. I""ve now spent 600 dollars to spend 299 on a device that was heavily discounted due to my mistreatment at another store. I've now already Purchased this item, and the Shure 1540 (that according to #121934’s “f\*\*cking store” I wouldn't be able to afford, hence him trying to offer my a 3000 dollar device)

 I’ve been embarrassed in public by a member of your Guitar Center Family.

Furthermore, Kevin’s guilt is sustained with the fact that he offered me the top Pro Coverage and offered to discount it 50%. I told him I didn’t want the pro coverage ( I didn’t even want to spend another dollar at the store) he kept trying to explain to me how if anything happened, etc.…but It was more in a condescending way---I’ve worked in Retail Management as a keyholder before... I know this game all too well and I NEVER forced anyone to purchase something…I kindly explained and highlighted the positives of a program rather than shedding light on the negative aspects it covers furthermore not crucifying someone for spending THEIR money how they choose. 

\#121934’s “f\*\*cking store” alleges he is a Psychology major/ student. Well listen…you really need to prioritze going back to school and leave retail alone man. I don't know how I'd reacted if my girlfriend wasn't there or if life didn't matter to me too much. Bro you really need to chill all the way down. YOu still got me heated.",1597086250.0,1

Fuck yes you're aggressive but you can actually drive your vehicle properly.  So, I'm talking about fucking cockbags who do the following.

1. LEFT LANE LOSERS:  You fucks who sit on a multi-lane highway, expressway, toll-road, interstate exactly at or below the speed limit.  You're oblivious to anything.... just bumble fucking along with no clue the entire world as someone to go. The left lane is for passing you dumbfucks. Get the fuck out of the left lane!

We, normal drivers should be allowed to immediately use a police type PIT and then immediately remove you from your car for a beating. STAY IN THE RIGHT FUCKING LANE WHERE YOU BELONG.

2. SlOW ASS MOTHER FUCKERS:   There's a special place for you to burn in hell for eternity for this shit.  You fucks who drive 10, 15 or 20 under the posted speed limit, on a two lane road on a bright sunny day with clean and clear pavement. WHAT THE FLAMING FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU.   Traffic stacks up behind you for a mile or more as you bumblefuck around to your useless destination. Do you realize WE that being normal driver's have jobs, lives and things to do while you slowing putz around with your thumb in your ass?  Are you just oblivious or do you delight it driving like you're a 105 year old who can't see over the steering wheel? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE that  has you so distracted to never notice the 50 cars piled behind you 

3. G-FORCES SCARE ME: Oh, you miserable little dick beaters who slow down to 5MPH to make a turn.  Do G-FORCES scare you?  Are you trying to save your brake pads and rotors?  Is it that fucking difficult to estimate your speed and position to make a turn at normal speed?  WHAT THE FUCK can't you handle about this basic driving skill?  Listen dumbshits, you aren't gonna die if you make the turn at 10 or 15 mph.
  
4. HERKY JERKY JERK OFFS. Yes you, you who can't decide to accelerate or brake. On the gas off the gas!  PICK ONE and stick to it.  If it's too fucking fast for you pull the fuck off the road.  Better yet stay the fuck home.

5. BRAKE LIGHT TRACKERS.  You fucks....are you blind?  You base your driving off the brake lights of the car a few feet in front of you. YOU SHOULD ALL BE BRAKE CHECKED. FUCK YOU.

6. HERD PARKING FAGS.  Listen cunt flaps...you see that vehicle parked way the fuck away from everyone else in the lot. THIS IS NOT a fucking invite for you to park right next to it.  We park away from you herding fucks for a reason.  GO PARK next to the fucking cart return.

20,i6qv7z,Complaints vs venting,"I’m going to complain about complaining. I’m currently in a relationship: it’s definitely good in that my partner is very responsible and reliable however he is terrible at validating my feelings and I think it’s going to be what brings us to an end because it makes me hate myself and in turn I certainly don’t have much energy for love.

So in some circles I’ve been known as the most positive happy person, and I don’t think my partner views me this way, in fact he has called my whiny before, and I can say I was “whining”.. it’s however starting to feel like a label I can’t get rid of and all I can think about is the fluidity of our emotions and even personalities and I feel like I’m trapped in a box that someone else built about who they think I am or who I’m supposed to be, the box I’m supposed to fit in, even if the box was a result of something I said or did.

Anyways, I strongly believe feelings like frustration, sadness, stress... feelings that are usually called negative and usually what is not acceptable in most social or professional settings and even in some type of people’s relationships, I think it’s total bull shit and I think these feelings are natural, and need to be expressed in healthy ways, these ways can not be healthy as people are seemingly expected to be happy and positive and fun to be around all the time. I feel like I can’t say anything “negative” around my partner because he sees everything as whining and I just need to feel heard- which then makes me more upset and more whiny and so we are in a cycle where I feel like I’m a volcano all the time. 

There is a difference between venting, complaining, and being negative. Yes there can be too much, and yes there can be this hopelessness that is really destructive, an anger that results in death...but I believe if I and people were aloud to express something without t being a big deal or a downer or a buzz kill or a negative Nancy, there wouldn’t be as much Nancy. Like maybe sometimes I just need to joke about the ridiculousness of a situation in order to cope with it, or I just need to state wow these instructions are really fucking frustrating and instead of being ignored like it’s going to go away or called a whiner it would be really nice to hear a “yea this fucking sucks and we are gonna suck it!” You know? Like face it don’t act like it’s wrong and supposed to magically go away and then all the sudden I feel even worse and I get upset at myself for being the way I am and feeling broken, I feel more upset for feeling than the original feeling. 

I come from a chaotic family that is very expressive and I am triggered sometimes
As a result of being a survivor of suicide loss, none of it’s an excuse but it feels incredibly lonely to feel the way I do, and it’s so hard to explain without sounding whiny or like it’s just another complaint. I also recognize that feeling broken is linked to my background while it isn’t the only factor it is something to be aware of as I  feel overwhelmed in my poisonous emotion. 

Please let me know if that makes sense? Anyone else feel this? I guess really I could say that’s why this forum exists.",1597006109.0,2
21,i6prmk,FUCK LIFE,"So found out about a week ago that the delivery company I have been working for for over a year and all through lockdown as a essential worker delivering to supermarkets and small shops between 11pm till 9am the next morning, not delivering stupid amazon parcels and things people ordered during lockdown out of boredom but I actually delivered to supermarkets and shops that was my job and I was classed as an essential worker anyway they told me about a week ago that they won't be paying furlough any longer as we eventually got furloughed towards the end of the furlough job retention scheme. They are refusing to pay 40 percent of our wage and they would receive the other 40 percent from the government to make up 80 percent of our monthly wages. Anyhow this company has tried to fuck me over on multiple occasions deliberately trying to get their workers furlough stopped by asking them to do shifts, the national citizens advice beaureu who I have a friend who works their they actually told us not to accept shifts as this will completely stop all furlough payments. These people are pure and utter scum, the universal credits I will now receive is 342 pounds a month until my company decide they need us back and realistically they will need us back as we all know the routes and drops and they can't teach these to new workers or agency as due to the 6 feet distancing guidelines 2 people cannot share a cab so this is fucking ridiculous I fully intend to slate and slander these appalling companies with the hope that they go out of business through lack of workers once I can find a new job. I'd genuinely rather scrape dog shit off the pavement, if I saw these scumbags on the street begging for even a penny I'd spit on them. I'd understand if they were a small company but they aren't they are a huge company so them just dropping their workers is absolutely disgusting especially after we worked through this pandemic doing essential deliveries to keep the supermarkets going and the country running I'm genuinely fuming I've had a very expensive few months, on my 4th car battery in a month as Halfords own brand are fucking shocking and die once a week my 4th battery now is a different brand and what a surprise it hasn't fucking died yet, some stupid bitch woman on her phone rear ended my classic car, my mums cars gearbox and clutch just blew up and she doesn't have the money to pay for it so I'm now getting up at 4am each morning to drop her off at work and picking her up from her first job and then dropping her off at her 2nd job as a carer and picking her up again, I'm paying for her gearbox costing 1100 pounds this had been a fucking appalling few weeks and we are all key workers in my household, we don't go on holiday we are basically on the breadline each month and it's fucking disgusting so as far as I'm concerned the companies I work for can go fuck themselves I can't obviously name them until I've found another job but I will ruin their name and drag them thru the dirt if I must. Asides that I've been cheated on multiple times in the past few years, I rolled my beautiful classic car on the way home from college just over a year ago and them stupid fucking pig cops blamed me as I'm a young driver, I might add that a young mum spun off 30 seconds ahead of me on the same corner with her young kids I then helped push her car out of the mud after crawling out of my overturned car in the dirt and nettles with petrol and oil spewing all over the place and helped set her on her way, the cops blamed me for the crash on a wet country road with basically bumper to bumper traffic so the notion that I could be speeding is fucking insane the only reason my car overturned is I tried to steer out of the slide to avoid crashing into the young mum and her kids who'd just spun off the road so my car went off sideways and the wheels dug into the mud and flipped us I will add this wasn't some modified piece of garbage boy racer this was completely immaculate and original classic so the notion it was my fault or that I am some sort of degenerate is fucking insane. Asides all of this fucking shit that I call a life I am a good person I help everyone and anyone, I do alot of DIY tasks for family and family friends despite them having very able bodied sons themselves so why should I fucking do it?? I still do cos I'm a nice person but I'm fucking sick of life, I don't drink alcohol or smoke or do drugs I spend what little money I have on my passion which is cars which is justified I have never even been abroad that's how much I don't spend money. To add to all of this I'm completely and utterly alone I have a twin brother and a mum and 1 nan and that is it I'm close with all 3 of them but I don't have a single friend asides my twin but it's lonely it's the same as talking to yourself with the same thoughts and opinions and likes and dislikes sometimes I just feel insane as though I'm chatting to myself and I just feel alone I'm super shy in real life but I'm a nice person I don't understand why even with 3 years at college I couldn't make a single friend.

25,i6b3a1,People who form their own line in a convenience store.,"In the store down the road from my home there is only one counter.  There are two registers and sometimes employees manning them both. However, it’s heavily implied that everyone is expected to wait in the same line for the next available register on a first come basis. That’s the way it’s always been and the natural order of things. It completely ruins the natural flow of things when some smartass decides that they’ll just start their own line and expect to be served the moment that a certain register is available. They then approach the register and cut in front of a dozen people or so who have been waiting patiently in the main line for the next available register. And even worse, there are the folks who stand far away from the line when there’s only one register open. They expect everyone else who chose to actually stand in line to memorize their place. So I may approach the register, thinking I’m next in line, only to have some degenerate get mad at me for cutting even though they are standing on the opposite side of the store from everyone standing in line. The store has never run out of room for people to stand in line, not even when it’s incredibly busy. There is no excuse for that behavior under any circumstances. And it will never stop because no decent person, including myself and the employees, will ever correct their behavior. Most people just want to go about their day without getting in a confrontation with some kindergarten dropout who doesn’t understand basic courtesy towards others.

40,i5qxaw,Awful teaching standards...,"So here I am. I am from Latin America, my English is mostly a combination of self-teaching and daily habit, and I am studying in a local institution so I can achieve the FCE certification form Cambridge.
In this same Institute (from here, the BRIT) there is a course called ELT (English Language Teaching) having 18 y.o and FCE cert. under your arm as requirements. So, here's the thing: I am in the next-to-last cycle of preparation for the FCE (technically, my last touch for ensuring I get proper qualifications in the test itself) and things are just so bad.
Not only the average of my classmates are bad enough for me to think they will be mostly getting a C or B1 on the FCE test itself (which means barely qualified and lowly qualifies, respectively). Like, how did they get this far?
What annoys me even more is just listening to this one teacher speaking in English. Up to now (I entered the BRIT from Advanced 1, the earliest of the last 6 cycles), the classes I've been at were taught at by now four different people. The first two were seasoned professionals and the third was an admitted novice in her first months, but the one teaching me now has some experience backing her position as a teacher. So, what's wrong here? Usage of English, pronunciation, vocabulary... like, how long has it been since this woman got her certificate? How much has she straightforwardly not practiced?

I'm tired of hearing people on the dole (Australian unemployment payments) complaining that they're screwed when the special payments for covid 19 go back down and how they're used to the money now. Fuck you, fuck you so much. 

I work in an essential industry and have had to work all the harder and be at bigger risk and haven't gotten squat. No tax breaks, no special payments, no relief, not a god damned thing. Essential industry workers have been butt fucked in this whole thing but the ones without work are the ones complaining. The dole is not a replacement for working income and you're lucky the government made the stupid decision to give you money in the first place. If it's going to be hard to go back to what you got before then use that fucking money to get a forklift license or warehouse certificate and get into an essential industry and get a job. 

You could get your license, a cheap vehicle, a qualification, interview clothing, safety gear etc etc to get a job. Instead it's getting spent on weed, Über Eats and late night munchies runs to the servo and fucking gambling. You're helping the economy a lot less than you think. Use the money smartly and stop wasting it and your time while you have a chance to better your situation permanently. No, instead you'll get stoned, high, pissed, off your chops and fuck yourself over.

I know work is harder (very hard) to come by nowadays and have been on the dole for long periods before because nobody would give me a fucking chance but if I had gotten a handout like this, I'd have made damned sure I'd used it to fix my situation rather than spend it stupidly.

Get smart with what you're getting while you're getting it and move your ass forward and not to the fucking couch or to your dealer's place so you don't have to be on the dole anymore and more importantly, shut your fucking trap when you're speaking to essential industry workers because we are getting fucked a lot harder than you.",1596745317.0,2

55,i4b0ks,Annoying bosses,"TLDR; I work in a big law firm and I have this boss at work and he got promoted within being 8 months at the company. Now that I was hired 3 months after he was hired, they expect me to be as “perfect” as he is (he’s only 26 while I’m 22) and this is also my first job at a big company (I used to work in a local law firm).

On March 2, I was supposed to get a medical evaluation for ADHD but that was the first day I was supposed to start work. I re-scheduled my evaluation to April 15. In the beginning of my training period, I told them that I never had any experience in this field and that this is all completely new to me. They said they would train me in the coming weeks. But COVID-19 happened and so we had to relocate back to our homes and I wasn’t able to take home my desktop from work. I also received a call from the clinic that I’m not able to get any evaluations until further notice. During this time, I had to work out of my 13-inch laptop for 7.5 hours and they would assign me too many projects for me to complete in one day. I was also seeing a therapist to help me cope with my anxieties and my traumas. 

On April 15, was the first time that my employers had reported me to HR because of the lack of communication on both parts. I complied and said that I will do my best keep communication so I made sure that I sent an email when I logged in for work and before I logged out; I was also making mistakes due to emails I send to the client; I made mistakes because of how the forms were improperly done; I also didn’t bill on time. All of these emails were coming to me daily with the words “unacceptable” and “wasting” within in. Stress was building up in my personal relationships and I started feeling worthless. I took out my stress on my family and my partner. I took my mistakes and I started taking note on what I need to work on and I stopped committing those same mistakes. I made minimal mistakes and it was only pointed out whenever I asked a clarifying question. Some mistakes that were pointed out were not even made by me.

On May 29, my therapist at the clinic said this would be the last time we would meet and she would reference me to another therapist but it would take a while. I panicked but I understood and it felt like I was losing a part of my reliever, someone I can talk to and be heard. 

On June 3, I was finally given an evaluation and I was prescribed Adderall. They advised me to tell my supervisors but I wanted to try to stay in this job without disclosing my condition. 

On June 17, I was put on a Performance Improvement Plan for the mistakes I made back in April and early May. I signed the plan. I told HR my situation with my ADHD and how I tried getting help before work. She said “Thank you for telling me but it doesn’t change the fact you’re on a PIP”. I felt angry and sad and regret for not saying anything earlier and for her not understanding my condition. I tried making things better and “paying more attention to detail” when they’re berating me on things they’ve never trained me on.

99,hwznfm,fucking parcelABC,"Let me tell you how my story got to this point, where airing to reddit seems to be my only option left.

Approximately 10 months ago, on September 26th, I had my eveningshift on my job (I work in a hotel). I worked together with the intern and we despite our differences, we were pretty good friends already.

Around 5 pm I watched the cameras how an intriguing young woman made her way to the reception. Something in her look just really spoke to me, maybe it was the fact she was completely my type, but I was drawn to her.  
Before she could even ring the small bell on our counter I already stood in front of her. She was standing tall and steady and her hair even appeared to be blowing in thewind a little bit, even though there was no wind in this closed environment. This image couldn't be more of the contrary of mine; I was frickoling quite nervously and my height never seemed that awkward before.

Her English wasn't perfect, mine isn't either, still we managed to communicate okay. She askes me where to go later that evening to have some Belgian beer. As sometimes I jokingly declare to other tourists, this is my specialisation, so I happily help her and point her to my favourite bars.  
While trying to flirt I gaze deepingly in her eyes while I mention my colleague and me are finishing our shifts at 11pm so we will head to this bar.

The rest of this story is already history but I can clearly re-live this night as everything seemed to fall in place perfectly.

Fast forward a few months and we already met in Paris and she came over here again. And needless to say, I fell tremendous for this Mexican lady.

As some of you might know; being in a long-distance relationship is hard. You always seem to be counting the seconds you spend apart from each other. To addon that, you seem to count them also when you are together.

To celebrate her birthday in May, we planned to go to New York.  
However; around March Covid-19 came into the picture and ruined these plans. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem, so this is not the reason I wrote on this forum.

To send her my love and warm her heart a bit in these cold times (she was in a lockdown then), I decided to send her a parcel with some smallthings.  
The original idea was to send a sweater my grandma knitted, a golden necklace I bought for her and some post cards from my whole family and me.  
Because the sweater was not done on time yet (I wanted to sendher the parcel for her birthday), I made the decision to send her other stuff; the necklace, some shampoos as a gift from my mother, a handwritten letter/poem from me and some chocolates.

I realised the latter might form an issue but while declaring the items to the site I would use to send them I never got a problem.

Now sending a parcel is pretty expensive, add the covid-crisis and you get a more expensive parcel.

After researching some parcel services I decided to use ParcelABC as an Intermedian to post my parcel.  
After buying their services, I got a mail DHL Express would be used for the postal service, so I was pretty happy with this news.

However, my happiness quickly turned into annoyance because of the way I was treated in the whole proces.  
During the first three weeks, I didn't get in contact with DHL/ParcelABC. Following my tracking code week 1 and 2 I never got problems, so I assumed everything was alright.

The third week of the process I decided to go on a little break, Belgium just got out of their lockdown so life was eased a little bit. During this break I didn't check my trackingcode again.  
This was about  when my girlfriend started to tell me she received messages from DHL Express, saying that she needed to hire some sort of Customs Officer/Lawyer to clear a parcel heading her way. Beause I got my share of Scamartists already, I told her to ignore this message. Soon she was called by DHL Express. They proved they were the legit organisation and again gave her the same message. Because this was my gift to my girlfriend I saw it as my duty to pay for extra costs. However; I was annoyed because I was never contacted in this issue. Also the site of ParcelABC gave me 0 explanation. It only showed; 'this parcel is being cleared in Mexico-city'.

So I sent ParcelABC a mail asking for some further info, while my girlfriend asked DHL why they never contacted me. As DHL stated, they already sent me 'multiple' emails, but when my girlfriend asked them to forward the mails they refused. They both speak Spanish. This will be adressed later.

After a few long discussions on the phone a member of DHL Mexico agreed to send the mails. When received, my emailadress was mistyped, also there was only one mail.

Via the forwarded mail my girlfriend sent me, I was able to send a mail to DHL Mexico, explaining my annoyance and adressing this whole situation (in English)  
During this process I got a mail from ParcelABC my contact details (my phone number) wasn't in use. I checked 3 times on the site and my number was correct. So I wrote them a message back claiming this.

The intitial communication via mail with DHL Mexico was never answered, my guess is because it was in English and the woman I adressed speaks only Spanish.   
After a long time of discussing on the phone and some mails from my girlfriend and me I got a short mail back from DHL Mexico, now an other team member, with all the rules a company has to apply to when importing goods into Mexico. As I do not own a company this was utter bullshit in my eyes. I replied this mail asking for the procedure for me but I never got a reply back.

Meanwhile ParcelABC had replied my mail, with a long pause in between. They stated the had forwarded my cellphone number to DHL and gave my the number of the helpdesk in the USA.  
Calling outside the European Union can reach up to 2 euros a minute. So needless to say I only tried 2 times before leaving them the voicemail to call me (I tried for 5 minutes each time.

During this whole hassle ParcelABC had sent me an email at 4 pm stating I had to pay extra to get the parcel into the country or it would be send back. At 11 pm I got an other mail from ParcelABC that my parcel was send back.

On top of this nonesense, my girlfriend (bless her for going through all this trouble), got DHL Express to state on the phone my parcel would be sent back free of charge. To this day they have never put this on email though.

Now ParcelABC wants me to pay double the amount of my initial costs to return the message from Mexico. When confronting them with the fact DHL stated my parcel was back in Europe the never replied. DHL never replied the mail where I asked them where my parcel was.

Finally through the Ombusman Belgium I got the answer from DHL stating my parcel is back in Europe. Forwarding this to ParcelABC they let me pay the whole amount because it had to travel back from Mexico to London, and then to my house.

I refuse to pay €100+ for this whole shitstorm I went through.

I contacted Ombudsman UK already (because ParcelABC is UK-based), they told me they can't help me because ParcelABC is not a member of their network. Other intermedians ask to wait 8 weeks between the making of the complaint and contacting them.

So in the meantime I use this forum as a place to let go my rage.

ps. does anybody know what I can do more to lay fire to these assholes? or at least give me back my money I insured the parcel for?

pps: feel free to spam their social network:

You KNOW your truck is governed at 66 or so yet you all persist in trying to pass each other and liberally will, regardless of traffic or road character.  You're a bunch of UNSAFE SELFISH CUNTS.  The right lane is where you belong in rigs that already can't do the speed limit on most Interstates. Why do you fucking bother to pass? WHY?????  You bung up miles of traffic as to creep around each other with a 1 or 2 mile an hour speed differential hoping you can somehow defy the laws of physics and pass on a 6 % uphill grade? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING????  Why do you inconsiderate FUCKSTICKS change lanes with NO regard for other traffic in your 36 ton death machine?  Do any of you actually read or speak English or are you all here on work visas stinking up the sleeper cabs with your co drivers like some sort of Somali refugees? Have you considered looking in the humongous mirrors you have on those trucks before you make this fucking dangerous and life threatening lane changes?

106,hwoyvf,My air conditioner,"My air conditioner has been a bit wonky for a long time now. Every time I turn it on, it seems fine at first, but every couple minutes, it makes a somewhat gurgling noise as if someone is loudly gurgling water in their mouth, but for almost 2 minutes at a time. Even if I turn it off, the noise continues for days on end. Its gotten so bad that I had to sleep in the living room instead of my room.

Now its kind of important to note that I still live with my parents. (I'm not old enough to move out on my own) The air conditioner problem has gotten so bad that I've actually gotten sick because it keeps me up most nights, and I guess my immune system got weak enough for something to get into my body. My parents have made many complaints to get it fixed, and it works fine for about a month max before it starts making noise again.

So this time my mother made a request to get it fixed again. Instead of making an appointment or sending someone over, they marked it as fixed. They practically ignored my mother. My father was pissed and complained, I wasn't there to see him complaining (since im sick, I was practically sleeping all day), but he told me that he practically demanded they send someone as soon as possible to get my air conditioner fixed.

We're still waiting for them to send someone over. My father also complained to our landlady about the problem, even making me get a recording of the noise and post it on YouTube (under a link only access, it was that big of a file) and we still haven't heard back from her.

Edit: I forgot to mention that its an expensive air conditioner, so we cant have it replaced easily.",1595541279.0,2
107,hwjpqi,Covid 19 / Black lives matter discussion,"Just found this thread about 10 mins ago to post about my day today and Halfords terrible quality and service, however I was wondering how many people have the same opinion as myself on current events.

Don't get me wrong the NHS are doing a wonderful job but, I've seen them go from strength to strength in filling their pockets, they got a clap (clap for the NHS) this doesn't include carers, binmen, delivery drivers, farmers, warehouse workers, shop workers ect a clap for all key workers would have been more fair as realistically the country would have stopped if the bin men stopped risking their lives to collect trash as they have to crowd into a cab together they can't social distance, if farmers or delivery drivers stopped stocking the shops we'd have come to a stand still so the notion that the NHS is keeping the country moving I find a absolutey disgusting to disregard the rest of the key workers. 

NHS staff got priority shopping where as binmen, carers, all key workers didn't get this simply because they aren't a part of the NHS. delivery drivers like myself who work nights to get things delivered to the shops we sleep during the day I have to do shopping for both my household and my nan, when it's eating into my sleeping time which makes my job more difficult and dangerous surely all key workers deserve priority in that case?

Other benefits to the NHS I saw is that they were getting free meals from mclaren and other things such as EE were giving all NHS workers free mobile contracts for 3 months or something, amongst other benefits only the NHS were receiving. To me this is absolutely vile, yes they are working more hours and more shifts at a greater risk, however other key workers should benefit from their increased workload not just NHS workers, plus NHS workers could afford all of these things perfectly easily as they are earning much more than a bin worker, delivery driver ect, I saw the coronavirus as a way for NHS workers to line their pockets and get appreciation for a job where they signed up to do that and save lives. Why do NHS workers need priority shopping if they are getting free food from mclaren anyway I'm sure they can stand in a line like every other key worker.

Despite all this people were signing petitions to give NHS workers a raise! Why? They've saved more money as they've paid for less because of all their benefits they have been receiving. Not only this but I feel its highly likely they would be the first people to moan if their bins hadn't been emptied and they had garbage Pilling up on their sidewalks with rats due to the hygiene issues so even thru their rose tinted glasses they can see bin men are key workers, people moaned at Boris Johnson for changing the slogan from protect the NHS to something like protect lives, people were outraged by this? Why? It's being inclusive of all, key worker or not! In a world where we are constantly reminded to be as inclusive as possible with peoples rights, feminism, lgbtq+ community ect we are told to be inclusive except for when it's a pandemic? Controversial but all lives matter, I understand black lives matter and what they are trying to do for black people, however the Jews have been victims throughout history, we don't have Jewish lives matter, All lives matter as we've been told to not look at race, colour, religion, sex ect we've grown to be as inclusive as possible yet people are always seeking to divide and segregate, that is exactly what the black lives matter movement is doing it is segregating black people from white people, no one religion, race, sex matters more than another, that is the thinking if Hitler if I'm not mistaken? People have compared all lives matter to being the same as saying all cancers matter... Do they not realise we have Marie curie cancer trust which is basically an all cancers matter.... We have separate cancer charities so we can have black lives matter but you need to have all lives matter for it to work otherwise your just segregating yourself from the majority of the population. Can anyone relate to how I'm feeling about all of this?

To satisfy the rules I'm stating that this isn't a racist attack or condoning what happened to George Floyd I can see both sides of the story I'm neither for or against black lives matter I'm on the fence this is just my opinions and how I see things feel free to comment and change my mind or give me insights as to why all lives matter is racist in comparison to a exclusive, segregated group I see all lives matter as a massive win personally, inclusive of all genders, sex, religion, colour, race literally it is trying to follow the norm of what society has told us to do which is be as inclusive as possible. The George floyd incident is tragic but that doesn't mean that all lives matter is racist or that all cops are bad, it just highlights the need for an investigation into corruption, violence, ect in the police force, most cops are lovely normal people just doing their job, the media isn't interested in showing when cops aren't being violent towards protestors, the media is as much to blame for the riots across the world as they deliberately show violence to generate anger as anger generates views, your not likely to watch a cop kneel with protestors and talk to peaceful protestors in a one to one but you will watch riot police shoot at rioters and tear gas them.",1595524678.0,2

109,hwitmt,Halfords!,"So I have a classic vauxhall as my daily driver  I've never had any faults with it but it was part restored last year,bodywork, fresh paint, some mechanical overhauling ect by no means a show winner or flawless just a good reliable daily driver. Had no issues asides a temperamental carburettor and a snapped accelerator cable, asides that it's got no exhaust which I don't mind. Problem started about a month or so ago, I went out one day and no power at all to the dash and barely any to lights, wipers ect so I go to Halfords and get a new battery, normally I'd go see my mechanic as I have no clue with most things like this however its lockdown and he's not open yet so I go to Halfords find a really helpful mechanic who helps me find the correct battery cos I have no clue with this stuff but its exactly the same as my old bosch battery just a Halfords branded one, paid 92 quid for it and went on my way. A week later my car has the same problem, I go straight to my mechanic thinking it can't possibly be the battery. 40 quid later he's checked alternator, fuses, starter the lot and can't find a single fault asides the battery it won't even take a charge. Go to Halfords and they battery test it and it says it needs replacing immediately and I'm thinking annoying but must be sorted. Another week later again it dies so I go straight to my mechanic and ask him, he says he's been over it and can't find any problems but I still book it in again and go get a new battery from Halfords so now I'm on battery 3 and he's saying it must be the alternator despite the fact I've just had it checked a week ago I insist it isn't the car but say I've got it booked in regardless, the appointment is in about 2 days so I go home and disconnect my battery so nothing could possibly drain it, reattach it and take to the mechanics 2 days later and he charges the battery as it was on about half of a full charge, this took 12 hours and cost another 40 quid but he still double checked the alternator and fuses and everything else to no avail the fault is with the battery so I'm thinking must be fine now then he's managed to charge it so no problems. A week later it's dead yet again I go see my mechanic in my mums car with the battery in the boot he says go to Halfords get a refund get a battery from elsewhere and I agree this is what I'll do, I then go to drive to Halfords and my mums car dies on a roundabout, gearbox, propshaft or something went, no drive at all  I'm stranded on the path at the edge of a roundabout, about an hour later I'm rescued for 50 quid and taken back to my local garage, he can't look at it for about a month, no courtesy cars and no other staff working with him. He lends me a jump pack and I have to carry my battery about a mile home from the mechanics to my car at home, I walk home, spill the acid stuff down me and it burns and itches so I'm thinking what a wonderful day, I jump the car when I get home and go to Halfords where they proceed to talk down to me, tell me the issue is my car, I tell them its been to the garage twice now and they can't find any faults, they are rude and egotistical about saying they've worked here for however many years and they've never had this happen where I'm on battery number 3 at this point, this fat Karen decides to be rude and I'm very polite and I insist it's not the car, regardless of me saying she can ring the garage and they will corroborate my story she refuses to listen. She then refuses to give me a replacement battery despite having a 4 year warranty on it and it clearly dosent work. She claims I must have the wrong battery type for my car, I laugh at this point as I actually pointed out that I know nothing about batteries and electrics so I asked the mechanic who works in this store to help me find the correct battery last time so any fault with the wrong battery lies with them, regardless she refuses to give me a replacement so I have no choice but to return it to her which I'm I titled to do as a separate thing to getting a replacement, I then but the exact same battery but a different brand they stock in the shop, so far so good no issues but we'll just have to wait and see. Despite her insistant that this has never happened there was a trolly of old batteries next to the counter a few were genuinely old and dirty, a few were different sizes of their Halford batteries clearly brand new all clean with good clean connectors on top 😂 shut your mouth Karen I have eyes 😂 but seriously don't buy from Halfords absolutely terrible quality, no empathy, staff are horrendously rude, the mechanics are the only nice people who work there who know what they are talking about I've experienced how rude their staff are before as I had a bitchy gay man behind the counter throw a pound coin at me when he couldn't do simple maths in a return/exchange situation I had for light bulbs so yeah avoid Halfords like the plauge please!",1595521948.0,1

He told me a lot of his flaws (drug addiction and more) and I thought he was regretting things he done wrong. I tried to help him fix his life. But he kept getting in trouble and didn't accept the responsibility for his behaviour or deeds he didn't realize that there was no bad luck only bad choices. I stopped talking seriously to him 'cause he didn't remember what I said. He messed up and expected that I rescue him immediately. I stopped rescuing him and he offended me and lied ... long story short he ended in rehab. I thought when he is sober he will understand his errors and apologize. He did, but it was a cheap excuse and I was mistrustful and his behaviour didn't change, he still thinks that he is the poor guy and everyone else is lucky. Now he is angry at me because he thinks I only took advantage of him. I can't believe that. How incredible stupid would it be to exploit someone without a benefit and just expenses.

121,hv002x,Crazy “mother in law”,"Okay so a little backstory, I moved in with my gf and her family about a year ago after a pretty bad argument with my family. Things were going fine for the longest time but when the “mother in law” in this situation lost her job her stress skyrocketed. I always knew she wasn’t the biggest fan of me because of my family but she was willing to put that aside for her daughter. 

However now she’s quite literally lost her mind. She’s begun being very passive aggressive with things she does around the house that include me in anyway. Usually talking loud enough for me to hear her through the walls saying negative things about me but never to my face. Finally the other day she blew up and began hollering about how I don’t do anything(not true) am an asshole(am polite to her) and that at the end of the day I’m just some kid with nowhere to go. So I was like wtf of course and asked her what’s wrong. 

She began arguing with me about how I was talking shit and I kept asking her exactly what. She kept saying “oh you know” over and over but wouldn’t tell me what. So I eventually chalked it up to it being some sort of bipolar anger episode but she hasn’t let up. 

She then began going on about how no one loves her here and I said wtf your daughter(my girlfriend) does (this was said right in front of my girlfriend) and she said “yeah fucking right she loves you and that’s it.” I was so taken aback I didn’t know what to say other than that I didn’t know what’s going on and she needs to take a step back and breathe. The next day she gave me a very insincere apology and I said it’s fine. 

But today she goes off on me again because I hadn’t turned on the outside lights for my girlfriend to come home since she was working late. This shouldn’t have been an issue since my girlfriend wasn’t coming home for another hour and a half. She just wanted the light on for her and her son to smoke weed outside I think. 

I asked her what I could do to alleviate the tension between us and that’s when she finally admitted to actively disliking me, saying I think I’m better than everyone, and saying I’m my father. Luckily for me I deal with psych patients a lot and so most of these things bounced off me but it really pissed me off when she called me my father since she knows our relationship is broken with him for things he has done. 

So I said fine I don’t want us to fight and left her alone. Of course she couldn’t do that though so she continues hollering about me from her room and finally yells at me that rent has gone up and goes outside where she yells at her son to not talk to me anymore and that she wants me out ASAP. 

So I told my girlfriend we’re leaving by the end of the week, she can come if she wants but I can’t stay here. So now I have an option of living in a motel or crawling back to my family after being almost no contact for a year.

Anyways, this girl and I used to just talk and be normal. Nothing was akward or wierd, we just acted like friends do. But after the ~4 people knew. She stopped responding to me whatsoever, and it just bothers me that I can't trust people now. I stopped trusting people, but I guess I got to comfortable. Now I know that I shouldn't.

144,hsk518,My little brother is the pinnacle of annoying,"This is my first post. Tell me if I'm doing it right😀

I would consider myself a person from a well-off family. (Not gonna get into the details that nobody cares about) My parents are fine, albeit a little insane (or maybe that's my teenage stubbornness) and give me everything that I need. My brother, however, is, well, the pinnacle of annoying.

My brother and I share a four year gap in age. This is the worst kind of gap. At all times, hes old enough to hurt me but found enough to be hurt much worse back.

He is a little devil, him. He always finds ways to nag at me, annoy me, and such. After he got into the terrible twos, he understands that I am annoyed and continues doing it, seemingly because he can, and I can't hurt him. The fact that he is crybaby is also part of this. He also has sharp canines which I got to feel more times than I wish to.

Intros over. The reason why I'm making this complaint is because of a new thing: coronavirus. The virus has changed all of us, making me more antisocial and giving me a shorter fuse, and he changed from a psycho to a full blown spawn of the devil. (The fact that school also doesn't happen and I have to spend much more time with him may have influenced this observation) Apparantly, he thought this time would be the perfect time to get back at me for all of the infractions that I did to him. He became louder, never letting me have my alone time. He became more of a girly tattletale than anything else. Actually, I'm wrong. He's become a mosquito that you can't swat. I need advice. How do I stop his behavior without hurting him?

159,hqgvzr,Why does my family love my cat,"I have a 4 year old (we think) maincoon.
We got him when he was already an adult. I wanted a kitten but my mom was insistent we buy an adult because kittens get adopted very easily and cats don't. 
He was an impulse purchase.
My mom heard some rats in the attic and she said ""get in the car. We're getting a cat."" We didn't even consult my dad or my brother who were at work.
So we went to the shelter. I named him Kevin because at the time I had just seen Minions (the movie) and I wanted him to be my little minion. I couldn't name him Stewart because we already knew a Stewart and my mom didn't like Bob. 
And I've always loved the idea of giving him a human name because it's fun to see how long it takes for other people to realize I'm not talking about a person. Ex... ""Kevin threw up on the carpet again""

But it turns out he's really mean. He bites and scratches really hard. He destroyed every single piece of furniture in our house. He beats up our dog ( an old, sweet Labrador/ Great Dane mutt who is too nice to defend himself despite being 10x larger than that damn cat.)
He wakes my dad up at 6 to feed him wet food 
Kevin is a major asshole.
He's very photogenic and handsome so everyone loves him in the pictures. My mom has friends who would want him so I've been trying to get her to give him to them for years.

166,hpbmqv,Why I don't like the term Latino/ Hispanic,"I'm Dominican so for Americans that classifies me as latino/hispanic but I hate that label because is not a race nor a common heritage. First, if I have to classify my race according to my ancestry it would be European ( Portuguese, French and Spanish), berber, afro Caribbean, Chinese. So, there are different races and ethnicities in Latin America. And the term Latin America was create to distinguish the part of the American continent that was colonized by Spain, Portugal and France which are the originals Latin countries and when they meant Latin countries it refers to the countries who descent of the Roman empire and speak a language derivated from the Latin language. Second Latin is not a race because for example Shakira's mother is Spanish and her dad is Lebanese but Shakira was born in Colombia, Lele Pons is half Spanish half Italian but she was born in Venezuela according to the US census if Lele and Shakira were born in the USA they would be white people, so how being a native Spanish speakers make them POC. Third I don't see people referring to Americans and Canadians as Anglo Saxon because if you're going to label the countries that speak a Latin derivated language like Spanish/ French/ Portuguese Latinos them Americans and Canadians should be called Anglo Saxons no matter if they're white, black, asian or native American after all they speak the same language and share the same country, right? I bet that if that was the case all of the the Americans and Canadians will be mad. And Finally Mexican, Dominican, Colombian, Venezuelan, etc are not races, they're nationalities, so no there is no such a thing as half Mexican, if you're mother is white but she was born in Mexico and you're dad is white and was born in the USA then you're white, you're only biracial if you're parents are of different races not different countries, if they're of different countries then you're bicultural.",1594480531.0,7

I'm her caregiver and she has COPD, but she makes it out to be like she is totally debilitated and she's NOT. It may be hard for her to breathe but if she just pace herself she can get things done. She wants me to do every LITTLE THING for her. I told her not doing the little things is what's making it worse on her because she's overweight and is diabetic as well. All she does is sit and watch TV all day. She only gets up to go to the bathroom. She will barely go to the kitchen. And now she talked to her workers and told them she needed more help with cooking meals. WTF. I already told her I don't like cooking, she's too f\*\*king picky and wants HUGE meals. (for example, she bbq'd a few days ago and she asked me to fix her a plate. i gave her a little of everything, yet when I brought the plate she wanted some eggs that she had made too! I didn't think of the eggs, because they are not really part of a meal unless it's a salad. But she was like ""you should have asked me what I wanted."" WTH. I was doing you a favor. Be happy with what I put on your plate.)

I only make meals for her twice a week now and with the new added hours that means I'm gonna have to F\*\* cook every damn day like 2 times a day. I don't even f\*\*king cook for myself unless I haven't eaten in like days. I usually get pre-made meals or things that don't require you to cook. I'm talking sandwiches, lunchables, frozen meals, etc. So basically she wants me to be her f\*cking maid and do everything for her. And what sucks even more is that my brother be right there and SHE WILL STILL CALL ME. LIKE DAMN, I'M NOT YOUR MAID, YOUR SERVANT OR YOUR BABYSITTER.  I'm your PAID caregiver and I work 2 days a week. The rest is voluntary and it pisses me off.

When I was living on my own for 6 years, I had to do everything on my own. NO ONE CAME TO HELP ME OR SEE ABOUT ME - INCLUDING HER. So why the hell can't she do things on her own? AND She eats hella early. I don't get up until 10am - 12pm. But that's because I have insomnia and won't go to sleep until 8 IN THE MORNING. Yet she will still WAKE ME UP. To get her something or to ask me to fix her something. WTF. She walked in here right now to ask....she could've walked her ass in the kitchen, took a breather and fixed her own damn food.

That's the one thing I've always hated about my mom, she will play the helpless damsel in distress to the full. I try asking her, if I wasn't here, then what would you do? You'd do it yourself no matter how long it took you to do it. I get tired of this shit. I'm not a child anymore yet you call me to do every damn thing for you. I don't want to be her caregiver anymore, but I'm disabled and cannot work an everyday 9 to 5 job and it's my only income besides my web design job.

177,hn5uyu,APOLLO LIFT sells defective and dangerous heavy equipment,"On 6/23, I purchased a ""brand new"" electric stacker (advertised here: [https://www.apolloliftus.com/product-page/semi-electric-stacker-cdd10b-iii](https://www.apolloliftus.com/product-page/semi-electric-stacker-cdd10b-iii)). On 6/29, upon receipt of the product, it was clearly defective and missing a crucial component that rendered the machine completely inoperable. Namely, the apparatus that connects the chain to the fork was missing.

I immediately contacted the merchant and he denied responsibility and advised that I could repair the machine with nuts and bolts. I am, under no circumstance whatsoever, qualified to repair heavy industrial equipment that weighs over 1200 pounds and I cannot accept liability for potential workplace hazards that may occur if repair is made improperly. Yet, the merchant refuses to honor his own advertised warranty, refuses to take responsibility, and even goes so far as to claim that I ""artificially"" damaged the machine.  

Moreover, communications with the merchant suggest deceit and a pattern of past fraud. For example, he dishonestly misrepresents the cost of freight, claiming that he has ""already spend $500 to ship to you"", despite the fact that I bore the original cost of freight at a cost of $180, and that he would not ""spend $500 to return this"". His refusal to properly address a defect is a breach of his advertised warranty on the product. He admits that he has, in the past, frequently ""dealt with customers like you"", which suggests a pattern of product quality issues.  

The merchant has categorically denied me any reasonable relief. He has stated that ""the chain was artificially disassembled"" and thereby denied me any refund by claiming that a refund will only happen ""If nothing damaged"", which is clearly not the case. Notwithstanding, he asked me to bear the cost of freight both ways and also to pay a 10% restocking fee in addition to paying for a defect that is clearly not my responsibility.

The merchant has a hostile attitude and has told me to ""do whatever you want"", leaving me with no recourse but to pursue all avenues available to recover my money for this defective and inoperable product.

179,hn1qs8,Do not buy from 123securityproducts.com,"I ordered a doorbell camera from [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com). I did not hear anything from them after ordering for two weeks, so I started reaching out and was told that the product was backordered. After being given several different dates of potential shipment, I realized that the shipment would continue to be pushed back. I contacted the manufacturer of the doorbell camera that I had ordered to ask if there was in fact a backorder, and they said that they had plenty of stock in hand for over a month. When I brought up [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com) as the vendor I had purchased through, the manufacturer told me that [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com) is NOT AN AUTHORIZED VENDOR, and thus should not have this product listed on their site. At this point, [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com) still had my money, and it had been almost a month since I placed my order, so I asked them about the shipment one more time. They claimed that they would ""dropship"" the item to me and I would have it the next day. I was worried about [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com)  not being an authorized seller, but I was glad that I would finally have the product I ordered. Unfortunately, the product was not delivered to me the next day as promised and it actually took several days to even get a tracking number and shipment confirmation. The reason I ordered through [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com)  was because their price on the item was the best I had seen at the time. Unfortunately, after they ""dropshipped"" the item to me, they charged my credit card a second time for the difference in price, adding another $26 to the $175 order WITHOUT ASKING MY PERMISSION and WITHOUT MY CONSENT. This has never happened to me before, and I'm so glad that I monitored my credit account, as I was able to catch this transaction while it was still pending and have them cancel it. I had a horrible time dealing with several of the customer service agents, especially one who seems to be the VP and owner of the company. When I asked about the dropshipping process, she responded to me by email starting with ""duh!"" which was also a first for me, as it seemed extremely unprofessional. This company's practices are extremely shady, and if you're ordering from them because of the price or the BBB rating, I implore you to consider the issues I faced. If you'd like good customer service, timely delivery, and general communication, DO NOT BUY FROM [123securityproducts.com](https://123securityproducts.com).",1594151594.0,3

Hate your job?  Apply for a new one.  Go back to school.  Move to a new city, state or even country.  Can’t afford to move?  Sell your stuff (you can always buy or find stuff again!), hop a bus, and make some changes.

I want to just lay on my back and listen to music for hours if I feel like it and not have to explain why I want to do it.

197,hkh4ls,I cannot believe how dysfunctional streaming services are.,"I have paid for crunchy roll in the past, but decided not to use it against because even a paid service has issues with resolution and subtitle synching. 

Since I could not find Jojo's Bizarre adventure on anything else however, I decided to use it again. The unpaid version has ads, but if that was the only problem it would be fine.

I just spent 4 hours and 52 minutes watching ads and trying to sort out why the video wasn't working and also looking for alternatives. In the end I got past the ads on crunchy roll and watch the last 5 minutes of the video.....

Yes, 5 minutes you fucking heard me. I watched \~3 hours of ads for that.

The ads were on loop. The last ad would play, the video would crash, then when the page reloaded, it would play the ads again. After seeing them for 30 minutes, (and this is not the first time it happened, but never has it happened for this long), I had decided that I would never pay crunchy roll another cent, as in the past I still had issues with their paid service.

&#x200B;

So I went looking for alternatives, after watching adds for 3 hours, and to my amazement found none. First I looked at Hulu, then learned that it's American only. Fine I thought. Then I went to Apple TV, as Apple has a good reputation for not breaking. 

When I tried to pay for the service, I was given  the message: Cannot verify with debit cards. So it didn't accept my card, which os the only 1 I have. 

At this point it had been 4 hours and 51 minutes. I was no longer angry, just perplexed. How can streaming services be this bad? So bad that a random user can run into this much trouble.

&#x200B;

You would think that in order to make money, the service would be easy to use, to the point where you can just pay and have it work..

But I was unable to even pay for 2 of the services (both of which I have been given ads for, good luck figuring that one out because I'm not in America), and for the 1st, I had been bent over backwards so much by it, that I was never giving them a cent again.

This is only a little bit complaint, but I don't know where else to to put this. I was doing my bit, trying to social distance, wearing my mask and gloves, standing in line at the Dollar General to get some hand sanitizer. A new lady (no mask on) just slumps up between me and the nice lady I was in line behind (henceforth I shall call the nice lady Helen, because I like that name). Helen has on a mask; Helen notices this new lady now standing 3 feet from each of us; Helen shoots me a significant look. I shrug in return.

Helen offers to let me ahead of her in line. I tell her thank you but I'm okay. New lady's body language tells me she now realizes she's cut in line; new lady says nothing. The line is long; new lady continues to creep into Helen's 6 feet, making it more like 4 (again, I mention, not wearing a mask). When it's almost Helen's turn she asks if I'm sure I don't want to go ahead. I assure her I'm okay and thank her again. 

While Helen is checking out, new lady keeps creeping into her space. Helen says something I can't catch from 12 feet away through her mask. New lady says, ""Don't worry, I won't get too close,"" while standing too close. 🙄

A few minutes later, my transaction complete, I leave the store. New lady is peeling out of the parking lot. I see Helen in her car. We wave at each other at each other and though we're both still masked, we know each other is smiling.

So I went to back to school like a year ago and I eventually decided I didn't want to do it and I dropped out of the courses before even attending them. and in March I got a bill from them saying I owed the full amount for all the classes because according to the teachers I attended the classes. When I went and emailed them and said I never attended a class they said oh well both the professors said you were there so we're charging you. so after you know emails and emails about trying to get it off they finally tell me okay well one of them said you weren't there. So this was back in March and they said we'll let you know about the other one. Well coronavirus happened so I figured it would take some time. well now they just sent me another fucking piece of mail saying that I still owe money and they're going to send it to collections by July 30th if I don't pay it. So I emailed them again today and said please check with the other instructor that I never attended. Again they're saying that I attended. And now they're trying to give me another story about how I didn't call in enough time for the drop date. and that even if the instructor comes back and says I wasn't there I still owe 60% in the bill. Which is absolutely incorrect. Because when I tried to drop it the first time online it said I had to wait 2 weeks in order to drop. I wait 2 weeks try and drop it online it still won't let me so I call and I drop it within the 2 week period. But apparently that's not right somehow. And this was back in September of last year so I don't remember what the fuck date it was and they just got to tell me oh you dropped on this day I don't know if that's true because I'm an idiot and I didn't think that I would have to have all this documentation because I figured this was a fucking responsible school and knew what the fuck they were doing. Apparently I was wrong. The fact that they're going to try and send me to collections over stuff that I don't even OWE in the middle of a fucking pandemic when people are out of jobs, trying to send me to collections with fucking 30 days notice after I've already tried to get this off my bill for the past 5 months is unreal. it's disgusting. these people are garbage. I'm not paying fucking $400 for literally nothing you can send collections all you want fuck you",1593536672.0,3

213,hijo9a,I get so annoyed with upper middle class families.,"There's the husband who is fun and quirky. The wife who loves baking and sports. The kids who are well rounded and sheltered. They have a two story house with so much space that you could host a yoga class on each floor, and at least three very clean bathrooms. And then you go in with your fucked up marriage and messed up sense of humor and your crazy ass kids and you all act like gorillas compared to this privileged family..... and then they look at you like they feel bad for you for being normal. I get annoyed with those kind of super happy priviledged feel-sorry-for-you kind of people.

EDIT: I don't hate any upper mid class families for being well-off. I'm more-so annoyed with those of them that are totally ignorant of what they have in comparison to everyone else. It's just a little annoying to see a happy family in a beautiful house when they casually talk about the expensive things they're doing like everybody's capable of the same thing. Just a slight annoyance that's all.",1593507568.0,1
214,higajp,"Tired of my brother's underhanded complaints, just sick and tired of ""family"". PERIOD.","so today my brother just happened to be talking ""to himself"" because he never directed anything towards me and included my mother in the conversation, but she's in the hospital. so his complaint was that why we (my and my mother) don't have any money to buy toilet tissue and he just had to buy some. and that we have nothing to show for the money we got from the stimulus.

first of all, i spend $30 on toilet tissue, and other household needs EVERY MONTH for the past 3 YEARS with little to NO HELP from either of them and I just happen to miss paying for the last 2 months. Also, why we're at it, let's talk about how I've been cleaning the bathroom by myself for the past 4 YEARS behind 4 adults, including myself and one being an old woman with the runs that leaves poop running down the toilet every time she went (RIP died a few years ago). And also let's talk about how whenever he goes he leaves smudges of poop on the toilet. Also, let's talk about how I washed the dishes all the time when my mom didn't and when she gets sick how I'M the one to take care of her EVERY NEED when he's right there too. Also, let's talk about how when they don't check the tissue roll when they go in the bathroom and then CALL ME to get them some tissue, but if I did that, THEY WON'T GET IT FOR ME. So I always check for tissue before I close the door and I always check the toilet seat to make sure it's clean before I sit down.

Whenever I go to the bathroom i have to clean the toilet seat before i sit down, doesn't matter if he went or my mom went. Now, let's talk about how I lived alone for 6 years in a 2bd/2ba apt, paying the rent and utilities on my own and not once did I need to clean the toilet after someone who visited and used the bathroom nor did I need to clean my personal bathroom every freakin week. I barely had to touch my bathroom. I basically wiped down the shower (to keep mildew at bay) and toilet seat once every 2 weeks.

And by the way, what i do with MY MONEY is my business. and What do I have to show for it? The freaking books I bought and the BILLS I PAID. I'm not hording thousands of dollars like him and doing nothing with it and saying...oh i don't have any money. and then saying oh we can go in $200 each to get a refrigerator when i have thousands of dollars in the bank. I'm not spending $200 on a refrigerator when i'm about to leave the state AND when i only use a FREAKIN drawer and a small space for a box of sodas for my food. the rest of the refrigerator and freezer is filled with THEIR food.

Oh, let's also talk about how he always just comes in my room without knocking. And gets upset if I do the same to him. I don't lock my door because if something happened to me they wouldn't be able to get to me. So I keep it unlocked but closed and yet they still don't knock on my door.

I'm tired of his underhanded complaining and snide comments. He 'talks' to himself and says what's bothering him and make it seem like I don't do anything around here...well to be fair I don't anymore. I don't use the dishes so why should I wash them. I use paper plates if I need a plate. I don't need to cook because I get processed food. If I do have to cook, I wash the dish as soon as i'm done. If there aren't any paper plates, I usually go without food, which is why i always get lunchables or something I can make a sandwich with. 

I got tired of washing all the dishes my mom and him used. I got tired of always cleaning the bathroom behind them. I only clean every once in a while, just so it doesn't get too bad. And then he have the nerve to complain about 2 women living in filth, not cleaning behind themselves...NIGGA YOU LIVE HERE TOO! We're NOT your maids. He complains about emptying the garbage because he don't make it....WE clean and do everything else, that's the least you can do and he don't even collect the trash around the house I DO, he just takes it outside. I started taking out my own trash because of his BS complaining.

And my mom don't take up for me at all. And she calls me for every little thing, especially when she get sick. She act like the whole world need to wait on her. Hell, I was alone for 6 years and nobody came to take care of me when I was sick. I had to call my step-dad to take me to the ER a few times. I had to walk to the store each week for groceries because no one wanted to come way where I was to give me a ride. I had to do it on THEIR time and PAY for gas.

And just because he didn't spend his stimulus check that he didn't deserve because he wasn't wanting for money. He had thousands of dollars before he got the stimulus check and now he wants to complain that we're not buying tissue for the past 2 months because our money is gone and he had too even though he has to use tissue to wipe his ass as well? WTF! This is BS. I can't wait to move outta here and back to California. It was steep rent but damn if I live with anyone else after this.

225,hesmhb,Mother with an attitude,"So I’m 19F and still live at home. I share a room with my sister who is 9. This is important. I feel I’m too old to be sharing a room with her. My mother however thinks I just need to deal with it. Which obviously I do because it’s not like I have a choice I just think it’s ridiculous that she doesn’t understand how this is a problem. So we were having a conversation about that early and she got mad because we’re looking at new places to live and I’ve been trying to convince her to get a 3 bedroom and she’s only looking at 2 bedrooms. All she cares about is a washer and dryer and I told her that’s not fair. 

She doesn’t want me to move out so I can help out nor do I want to move out because I’m saving for my own house but I think if she wants me to help out she could give a little and look at 3 bedrooms. So we’re discussing this and I told her neither of us want to share a room and she only wants to do what’s convenient for her. She gets mad and starts yelling about how I’m only thinking about myself and she’s not picking a place for my benefit she’s thinking of everyone. But I know for a fact my sister doesn’t want to share with me either we’ve been sharing since she was 3 years old. 

So we get into this argument she’s calling me selfish and it turned into her telling me that I don’t care about my sister and she was slamming doors and she wasn’t talking to me. Then I get in bed lay down ready to go to bed and she comes in and tells me I need to clean the kitchen. No exaggeration at all there was one pan and two cups that needed to be washed.

As if getting a girl wasn't hard enough, now I have to accept the fact that I might not have a relationship for another decade.

This corona shit is so annoying and I'm at that wonderful age of 21 where I only think of myself and all I care about is girls.

In March, I went out with some friends as the start of something new; I'm shy and introverted but for the first time, I was ready to but effort in to go out and meet people (instead of relying on dating apps). As soon as I was out with friends, everything shut and we never got to do anything. These rules are just forcing me into the very life I was actively trying to escape.

As for the government saying ""you are your safest sex partner"" that just makes me so mad because most of them are already married, in a relationship… whatever. It's so rubbish being single, as a lot of you know, there is no substitute for physical affection. My sex drive is through the roof and as usual, there's nothing I can do about it. Masturbation only makes me want intimacy more and I end up depressed AF afterwards. On top of this, my only relationship lasted a month and was years ago.

I've always been lonely, but this is the cherry on the cake. The dating world has gone from hard to impossible. Even if I try to break some rules, it's extremely hard work making any progress.

248,hchft5,My PC and its nonexistent parental controls,"Kind of a funny complaint but it’s annoying the hell out of me. So basically, my PC has parental controls on me that my parents did not put on. My parents trust me a lot and I’ve done mostly everything in my life all by myself without their influence or help just fine so they had no reason to put parental controls on me when I got my first ever laptop many years ago. To avoid parental controls I was instructed by my mom to make myself 4 years older or something like that on my account (I was 11 or 12 so I registered myself as 15 or 16 which I think was when they wouldn’t make you put on parental controls, could be older) and it was just fine for like a year or two. 

UNTIL Windows decides that they and Bill Gates are my parents all of a sudden and my PC suddenly decides that just before “I” turn 17 I should be put on parental controls. They literally just appeared one day and I had no idea how they got there, but I ignored it and said “eh, who cares, according to my account I’m 18 next year anyways, they’ll slacken up, if I need something that’s blocked off I’ll just put it on a list.

But it never did. According to my account I’m at least somewhere between 19-21 (I set my birthday between 1999 and 2001) and my PC is still babying me. I would be fine with it if it wasn’t so damn strict- I love video game mods and often when I try to download anything at all, not even adult related my PC will just randomly say “no, ask your parents, we’ll send an email to your parents blah blah”

I DON’T HAVE PARENTS ON WINDOWS AND ACCORDING TO MY FAKE BIRTHDAY I’M PRETTY MUCH A FULL GROWN MAN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

And even better, my parents aren’t receiving any emails, nor me. We’ve tried to sort this out so many times, but even if I register them as parents (they often get the message that “your child is over 18 lmao”) they won’t get the request, so who the hell is receiving those emails?

I was with my little sister and her friend (we'll call my sister Sarah and her friend Alex) and my sister had a baby doll. Her other friend (he's the a-hole from my last post. We'll call him Sam again) We played a game with my sister's doll where we threw it around and whoever made it to the picnic table first with the doll won. After a few rounds my sister decided to take the doll home and in response to this Sam wrestled her to the ground. That kid Alex didn't even LOOK like he gave a crap. I grabbed Sam and said, ""Why did you wrestle my sister?"" he pushed me. I grabbed the back of his shirt, and asked the question again. He ran away. I screamed, ""YOUR PARENTS WILL KNOW ABOUT THIS SAM!"" I ran over to Sam's front door and rang the doorbell. When I told Sam's dad about what happened, he sighed like it had happened many times. His dad came outside and said something and Sam started to cry. I liked to see that, but the next day, Sam was at the park again. I tell you, his parents do not discipline him enough.

One of my other friend's brothers said a meme and the kid that was punching my friend (we'll call him Sam) said he'd get his brother to beat my friend's brother up. Sam's mom came out then and said, ""DON'T DISRESPECT MY CHILDREN!"" and my friends got punished. Nobody believed my friend's side of the story. I have never hated Sam's mom so much.",1592578147.0,6

257,h9w7ui,I want to play video games but my computer is stupid,"I've always liked video games but I've never been the best and I'm ok with that I'm just happy to be playing them. I have a pretty shitty computer for example I remember when overwatch came out and I really wanted to play it but I couldn't because my computer was so bad I didnt even meet the requirements to support the game on my computer. Sometime after that I got part of a mouse stuck in my computer but I  kept trying to get a mouse but even if I plugged in a brand new mouse it never worked no matter how much I changed the batteries or tried and got a new mouse. So I started sticking to more chill games. Games where they didnt require a lot of moving around but I would still enjoy them.

But my computer cant even support some of those. For example I own Slime Rancher and Oxygen not included but everytime I try to play those games for more than an hour(if I'm lucky) my computer overheats. The graphics for Overcooked 2 and Slime Rancher both needed to drop to low quality for my computer to even run them. There is a new game that recently came out called Valorant and it reminded me of Overwatch which was a game I always wanted to play but yet again my shitty computer had to get in the way. I dont own a mouse and my computer wont let me use one and my computer is so shit that it overheated just trying to download it.

I just want to be able to play the games I want to and ar the minimum be able to have a computer that supports the game and a mouse so I can move around easily. It's not like I can say I would be good at these games if i had them but i would at least have a shot. I feel like if I just was able to play I would get at least halfway decent at some point. I dont own a single chair in my room and my desk is messy because I just have nowhere to put my stuff lol. I know this is a first world problem and I'm happy to just even have a computer but I just want a chance at playing them.

I dont have the money to go out and buy a better computer and trying to use the mousepad while playing a game is really difficult. A lot of times I'll see a game I really like but I'll give up on it because either my computer is too shit or using the mousepad is just too hard or I'll just feel like I cant play because everyone else will be years ahead of me.

I wasn’t completely against the idea, so I applied at a few places. I applied at a Golf Course, a Nursery (a place that sells flowers and plants) and a couple other places I would’ve enjoyed working at. At the nursery, which was my top pick for a job, you have to be 18, but a friend of mine got a job there and he’s also 15, so what the fuck? The other places never got back to me about my application. My mom found a job opportunity at a store/restaurant for me to work at, which my brother also works at. It’s a part time job. I got the job and now work there. I don’t work too many shifts a week but I H A T E it! I’m in the store doing the normal stuff for about an hour. Stocking, taking trash out, watering plants, etc. then for the rest of my shift I’m unusually in the kitchen. I hate the kitchen. I wash dishes for hours on end and it seems like my shifts never end.

&#x200B;

So I use the United States Postal Service just like anyone else around here. By and large, I'm glad it exists, but over the last five friggin years, I do kinda fantasize about it all burning to the ground sometimes. I moved to this po-dunk but very nice little town, it's sleepy and has maybe 50K people spread out over a huge county, I like living here, moved in with my mom after some family tragedy. I did the whole wait in line, fill the forms etc to have myself added on to her PO Box, easy peasy if a little time consuming, but no big deal. One year later, all my mail is being returned to sender because my name isn't on the box. Did the whole thing again. One year later, guess what. Did it again. ONE YEAR LATER... sending my mail back to the sender agaaaaaaain. By year five, I finally sent a complaint to the USPS. No reply for several months, no fix for my issue, I kept trying to submit or contact anyone through the website but no, nothing, then I get a survey about 'how great do I think they did on the resolution?' Not great at all! Why do I have to keep doing this??

&#x200B;

Okay, that's annoying, sure, but it's a small proverbial dragon that can be slain, even if it keeps coming back again. My mom doesn't have to go through this every year, just me! But sure, let's just brush that off. So let's say I've just gone and once again did the whole rigmarole again with getting my name on the box. Well now my mail should get to me, right? Nooooo no no no! SILLY FOOL! I don't get MY mail, I get 100+ paychecks meant for Dutch Brothers Coffee employees. Some lady's personal banking info. I got some company I've never heard of's tax junk. I made the mistake of ordering some bras online and had to wait till some dude returned my opened package of underroos before they were shoved in my mail box. Aside from the fact that I could be making an illegal mint fucking other people over, or that the PO by my home routinely just hands random people sensitive and personal info....

&#x200B;

I tried saying screw it then, I just wont use the PO Box. We have a proper mail box that we don't use because you have to walk or drive over a mile to get to it. I'm rural, dawg. That didn't work! Despite the mail box being RIGHT THERE, among several other mail boxes, with numbers right there on the door, HALF my mail wouldn't get to me because 'the mail box doesn't exist'. Weird, my mom gets all her mailbox spam (coupons, spam mail to either Resident or to her actual name' that we clean out regularly. Weird since I DO get half of my mail. So I guess the mail box only exits reality SOMETIMES. No, this isn't an issue of the box not being registered or recognized or me not having filled out change of address or anything else, I've done all my responsible moving and account stuff. It DOES get used, filled, and emptied, we just don't use the street address for accounts or orders where we can help it because of this shit, so it ONLY gets spam mail or the occasional info report for something legitimate. 

&#x200B;

I've watched on tracking as my mail goes back and forth and back and forth across the state for two god damned months straight, scanned again and again, back and forth, before someone finally decides to actually deliver it, either to me or to a friend six hours away from me depending on which it was destined to.

&#x200B;

These things are all annoying, and they're getting less 'I can live with it' by the year, each year is worse than the last.

&#x200B;

Here's the dumb, petty fucking thing I got angry about today. I make absolute bupkis for money, I literally make about $200 a month, and I manage my money like a miser to make sure I can live in good health and also have fun some times here and there as well. I saved up and got my mom and I a Hunt A Killer subscription for 6 months. That was a hard fought $165 bucks to blow on fun during quarantine , and rural living. We get excited for our monthly box and something to DO. Today's box was ripped to absolute shreds, folded in half, crushed down, and FORCED into our PO box to the point that it was stuck and my mom nearly punched herself in the face to get it out. If it doesn't fit, you're supposed to get a slip, go to the counter, and they get the package from the back.

&#x200B;

Well, considering how responsive the ACTUAL customer service for the USPS is, I figured I'll just post something on Reddit. Hey look, a USPS thread, perfect spot. Posted a picture of the torn apart box from inside the car right outside the post office. Bit of a snarky title, I admit, like 'great handling guys' or something with nothing else. Then a mod replied. 'Hey that sucks, hopefully you get a refund from the seller but we're not customer service', essentially. Nice thought, appreciated, but the reply I sent was pretty much 'yeah I know, there is no customer service, I've tried, I posted this so that maybe the USPS employees might see that this isn't an acceptable way to handle people's mail.' I was on my phone, I could have pecked out a longer, more detailed and dick sucking reply on a bumpy road but I didn't. And I was a little miffed. I'm not expecting some magic, I'm literally just like 'hey, this is not cool' at the people on Reddit that DO actually work for the USPS, posting pictures from their route, talking about their day at work AT the place that handles mail and their job AS mail handlers. The reply when the post was locked and taken down:

&#x200B;

""Basically, you'd like to guilt a large group of people who know better anyway and who probably had no direct handling of this package. If it makes you feel better to do so, then we can pretend this was left up in full view. Thanks for the post. It was absolutely pointless.""

&#x200B;

Kay. Maybe I could have ass kissed more in my reply. OR... Maybe I said what I meant. This is not an acceptable way to handle mail. IT'S NOT. No, I know the 36,928 members on the subreddit didn't personally handle my package. It's not my life saving medicine and I'm not gonna die because it was seriously damaged. I also know I'm not the only one that's had a brand new record snapped in half to fit into a PO Box, or had their mail opened, stolen, given away to strangers, mangled, run over, torn in half or anything else. When their bosses show them shit like this and say 'this is unacceptable', do they also flip their shit? I DIDN'T DO IT, WHY YOU YELLIN?! Well maybe because this is not cool and you should all see exactly what is not cool. It's not a fuckin guilt trip you moronic twat, it's a fact, and it's not the fault of the sender. THEY don't owe me a refund or a replacement. THEY didn't sneak into the post office, trash their own product and jam it in my PO Box. No, YOU didn't personally fuck my shit up. You work for the company that did and you should all know what's not okay, people get taught what an example is in first fuckin grade, agree that's shitty handling and no one should do that. My complaint and opinion is valid, you can either choose to take it personally like a dick or agree that no, no that's not fucking acceptable, and the people in your line of work as mail carriers and processors should know better and maybe learn from a bad example. 'That sucks but we're not all shit at our job, sorry mang' would have been a better reply than 'obviously this isn't our fault so hopefully you get a refund' + 'how dare you point out an ongoing USPS problem to people that should know that's not okay'

&#x200B;

But, the people that know better anyway are cool with treating your mail like that, and only the person that directly, personally handled my mail should ever be shown the product of a bad job, thank goodness they personally sign all my mail so I know exactly who did it. Oh, wait, no they don't. Pointing out a failure's just a big ol fuckin guilt trip. If you work for the post office and don't do that shit to packages, then great, good on you and I hope your work goes well, deep down inside I believe the USPS is necessary and vital. If you DO do that shit to packages, fuck you, get a different job. If you see someone doing shit like that to packages and don't stomp on that behavior right away, also fuck you.

&#x200B;

Do I feel better? Yeah, some. Not completely though. Cause I still have to use the god damned post office. I look forward to my next destroyed order. I also don't expect anyone read this longass bitchfest of mine, but the company won't do anything and I don't have anyone else to complain to.

I bought one of those 10' family pools for my son to learn how to swim and not be afraid of the water. He's 6 months old. I knew the girls would be excited that there's a pool here (we live with my MIL).
However. I don't know why, but I thought the girls would have more respect and ask before they jump in and all over it.
It's safe to assume that MIL said to go ahead because she came in and said, laughing, ""the girls didn't know we had a pool here, they're in it!""

Fuck yeah they can play in the pool, if they ask me first. I will not allow them to play in the pool as long as my son is in it because he is learning how to swim and not fear the water. I know the oldest daughter can handle it (she'd be upset but understand) but the youngest one is such a fucking brat. She would have an absolute shit fit knowing she's not allowed in the pool with her baby cousin.

273,h7p0nm,A Series of Shady Events,"It has now been a month and eight days since I ordered a pair of earbuds from the Razer company. Now that it's so clear my time and money are out the window, I might as well share this horrible experience and hopefully stop anyone else from getting screwed over.

&#x200B;

This all boils down to a terribly handled misdelivery.

&#x200B;

* I ordered my earbuds from Razer on May 4th, and they were scheduled to arrive on May 8th. May 8th, which was a Friday comes and the package remained marked as ""out for delivery"" the entire day. When I contacted FedEx for further information, they knew nothing and advised me to wait until Monday for any changes until I put in a claim for a lost package.  I received several contradicting text updates from FedEx after that, which is what stopped me from pushing for a claim when that Monday came.
* Fast forward to the morning of May 19th, I receive a text update telling me the package arrived on May 8th and was signed by ""CO19"".

*-How in the ever-loving hell could a package that was out for delivery all of May 8th, supposedly beship on May 11th, and its whereabouts completely unknown on the 12th be delivered on May8th? Also, CO19... really? These are a few of* ***many*** *discrepancies in this train wreck of an experience.*

* Now that I had solid confirmation something went very wrong I contacted Razer with this information. This was a misdelivery I needed to file a claim for. This was when I realized Razer customer service with an actual employee isn't really a thing. They have tech support and another number labeled as customer service on Google, which is just used as tech support. The person I spoke to on the phone redirected me to their online chat because god forbid they were to handle any fuckup on the phone.  I gave all the details to the guy on live chat and was told I'd get an update within 24 hours. Two days went by and they never contacted me with an update.

&#x200B;

**Please allow us \*insert amount of hours\* to respond is something you'll hear constantly when dealing with Razer employees. They'll most likely contact you late (if you're lucky) with a vague, unsatisfactory response.** 

&#x200B;

* I contacted Razer yet again. This time I managed to speak with someone on the phone. I had just got off the phone with the manager of the FedEx station in Brooklyn where everything went wrong. He told me all I had to do was contact the sender (Razer) to put in a claim with them. Simple enough, right? The Razer employee eventually sent me an email to fill out the information for the FedEx claim. *Could we really be making progress??? Things seem to be looking up.*
* I send such a thorough email for the claim. All discrepancies are mentioned, contradicting FedEx updates attached, and other pictures supporting the mix up that must have taken place between two buildings with the same address but different apartment numbers. My email is now responded by a new person from their ""executive response team"" who will now handle this case. 
* First, he tells me Razer's internal team will conduct an investigation with the courier from FedEx to confirm its delivery which will take a few days. Great! I would love to know just exactly where the courier delivered this package because **it never got to me!**
* It's now June 4th (one month since this cursed order was made) and I received an email telling me their team is still waiting for feedback from FedEx.
* On June 8th I contact FedEx because all trust and faith I could have in Razer are in the trash. I give FedEx the package tracking number and try to get some information on if a claim has been started. The FedEx employee I spoke to told me Razer closed to case/claim. Words can't explain the level of rage I experienced and continue to experience as I go over the games this clown factory of a company has and continues to play with me.
* I contact this Joebert person through email wanting to know what the hell is going on. He tells me he knows nothing about anything and needs another 24 hours to get information from their internal team.

***I'm going to throw up if anyone mentions this moronic ""internal team"" one more time.***

* 12 am EST this is the exact email I received

>I am writing this email to inform you that our internal team have not filed a claim for this order. According to their investigation, the order was delivered to its intended address. In line of this information, we would like to advise you to contact your financial institution to file for a dispute or chargeback against your order.  

There are so many things wrong with this:

1. FedEx said they closed the claim. This Razer employee is telling me their team never filed a claim, to begin with.
2. FedEx told me all I had to do was contact Razer to file a claim after hearing this entire situation. And from what I'm gathering, these assholes decided to say fuck this customer's time and her money. What company robs their customer of a claim when their own carrier service agreed that was the correct thing to do?
3. These people knew the issue was that the package was marked as delivered and never made it to my hands since the very first time I contacted them. It took their all-knowing internal team several weeks just to write me off. *Seriously?*
4. Most importantly, what the fuck does my bank have to do with anything? In all my years of online shopping, I have never heard anything like that while dealing with missing or misdelivered packages. That's an issue that is handled between the sender and carrier. Razer is so clearly above professionalism and proper procedure.

* Yesterday June 11th I tried getting a hold of an actual person to discuss the latest in this mess. I got a hold of someone and they hung up. I called back and the automated system said the line is highly busy and live chat should be used right before the line started beeping and went dead. Is this not the shadiest experience out there? It takes a lifetime to get through to any kind of person when you do they're either going to be brain dead to tell you to use the live chat on their site, and if you end up getting to the ""Razer Executive Response Team"" they will be vague, run circles around you waste days and weeks of your time, and hide behind their almighty ""internal team"" to avoid taking any kind of accountability.

&#x200B;

With all the mind games, these people have played it's definitely crossed my mind that I might be overreacting or possibly be in the wrong. Then, I think back to a package I thought went missing a few weeks ago. I contacted USPS and the company I ordered from informing them of the issue. USPS acknowledged the issue, and the company offered me a refund within the next few days. The package ended up turning up so none of that was necessary but that is how you deal with a misdelivery! I wasn't told to make a police report, or talk to my financial institution, or any other nonsense. That is how a professional company and its carrier service handles unfortunate fuckups. 

&#x200B;

To wrap up this endless saga of shady events, I'm no Karen. It's not my life goal to speak to people's managers or disrespect employees. I have a million better things to do with my time. These stupid earbuds were supposed to get me through the end of this semester of online schooling. The semester ended with me not even having earbuds to use. The package was in my name but a gift my mother paid for. I'm disgusted her money was thrown away on such a worthless company. $67 and over a month was wasted thanks to Razer.  I've got money, I'll take my business elsewhere but what kills me in this situation is being toyed with and robbed not only by whoever walked off with my package but by the company denying any kind of claim for it.

&#x200B;

Although I can not speak on the quality of Razer products because mine never made it to me I can wholeheartedly say this company known for selling these overpriced ""epic"" tech-related products provides $2 service.  I was so excited to finally purchase from Razer that scouring the internet for horror customer service stories wasn't on my to-do list. It was only until the damage was done that I found countless horror stories of this company playing their runaround games with customers who had issues with their orders. My goal was to purchase a PC from them, and I am so glad I didn't get robbed thousands of dollars and sent to hell by these assholes. Even *if* their products are good, is it worth going through ***all*** of this if something were to go wrong? I'm still disgusted and enraged but hopefully, my story provides some entertainment and saves someone time and money. ",1591982601.0,6
274,h7m9l4,USPS telling people my house is vacant and trying to get me robbed.,"My wife and I are both working from the cabin full time.  As such, we have forwarded our mail and are no longer in our home full time. 

Apparently there are ""we buy houses quick"" investors that get a list of vacated and not occupied.  A quick google search and I find that this is a list the the USPS provides to HUD and other non-profit agencies. But even according to HUD, this doesn't include address information, ""USPS does not provide HUD with a list of addresses or properties"".

But somehow people are getting a list of vacancies with my property address listed on it as I keep getting calls about selling my house and they all say that they got the information from the USPS. 

It seems like a terrible idea for them to sell the data that my house is vacant. No wonder my house has been broken into, they know no one is home. 

Selling or giving out vacancy information by the USPS is a huge invasion of my privacy and a terrible idea and needs to end.",1591974106.0,5

278,h15r0b,I don't think empaths are a real thing.,"I've seen a few people on social media recently say they can't handle the difficult things of the world right now. They're too sensative cause they're an empath so they're just going to ignore there problems, go off social media or what ever because they can't handle it. Like I get it, we all need a social media break now and then. But you cannot just ignore what's going on. If it makes you uncomfortable then you need to address it instead of running away. I honestly think being an ""empath"" is just a term for people who haven't figured out how to regulate their emotions and are too afraid to confront problems. My mom used to tell me I was an empath because I would try to carry the weight of the world on my shoulders. Turns out I just had undiagnosed bipolar disorder and had never been taught how to feel, interpret, and regulate my emotions.

2. You say ANYTHING against what an intolerant liberal believes and they go off on you (note I said ""intolerant"", so not all of them; also, I know that there are many if not just as many intolerant conservatives, but they are mostly stubborn older people and not within my peer group so that's not the focus of my complaint). They cannot leave you alone or agree to disagree; rather, they blame you for the problem (such as #BLM - some of them actually say that you are part of the problem if you do not stand with them. I for one support black lives 100 percent; I just don't want to associate myself with the specific movement). One thing Jesus teaches is to love your neighbor and to always forgive. They do NOT do this (and it's not even a matter of belief; the Bible says we have our conscience written on our hearts). They ironically ignore the concept of respect and tolerance when it comes to those who support Trump, don't support LGBT+, etc.NOTE: Before voicing your disagreement/berating me for complaint #2, please ask me any questions you have because chances are I just need to clarify a thing or two first.

284,h0o6l5,Meyne Wyatt Monologue (less a complaint and more an observation),"Now first things first. I agree with his points and his monologue moved me deeply. If you haven't seen it, please do. I've dated an indigenous woman who was fantastic (I was the problem dating too soon after a major break up) and one of my best mates is indigenous (amidst other bits but is seen to most people as indigenous, champion bloke). I've been raised right and racism isn't in me coz it makes no sense to me at all. I can see skin colour like anyone else but it makes no difference to me, people are people 

The points he made that I must raise small issues are:

Indigenous deaths in custody. 

Self harm is huge in indigenous men in custody. A lot of indigenous men hang themselves in custody or prison. While they may be used to freedom and going walk about, it's no excuse for killing yourself. I think in such cases Police DO need to keep a closer eye on indigenous men in custody and help prevent self-harm however if they take away blankets and sheets and all things that can be used for self-harm it would be painted as cruelty and racism. Walk about needs to be fucked off from indigenous culture as well. It's not teaching our indigenous people to tackle and face their issues, dealing with them in a rational manner. I agree with taking some time to clear your head but outright fucking off entirely isn't helping. Cultures need to evolve with the times. Definitely look into these deaths in custody and do our utmost to prevent them but also help give your indigenous peoples the tools to help deal with their issues. Help them see that self-harm isn't the way to go. Tackle it two fold.

Social exclusion.

My mate is my mate, not my black mate, not my indigenous mate, he is my mate and fuck anyone who says otherwise. Hell even my best friend (my brother in all but name and blood) could at any point go to the local Aunties and get his origins verified like his mum and sister but he doesn't want to be lumped into a category and get special treatment for it. There's the rub, indigenous people in Australia get their own separate government services as well as access to any non-indigenous services. Separation of services and special treatment drives a wedge between peoples. Being indigenous can get you interest free home loans (or so I'm told), it gets you into university easier (hence why my mates sister got her origins identified), can entitle you to preferential government housing or cheaper private rental (seen this myself with my indigenous friends who I helped move when I was a teenager), indigenous people get their own health teams, teams paid by the government to go get them off the streets at night and also use government fuel cards to pay for their cigarettes (which are expensive as fuck in Australia), there's employment preference for indigenous people (it shows up on jobs I've applied for). Some people resent this. They demand to know why and are generally shitty about that. Me, I don't really care. The government of Australia done fucked up big and should be held accountable. I take issue with separating people. That's the way it feels, it feels like we are being kept apart. There are cultural things where learning about their own cultural background is good for people but I'd like to learn too. So would a lot of kids in school. Two sides of a wound don't heal if they're kept apart.

Racism is two sided.

I'm not a racist, never have been, haven't gone around calling people nigger, black cunt, boong, abbo, coon or anything else. I know the words, I don't call people that. I have however lost count of how many times I've been called a white cunt, falsely been accused of being a racist (usually by people breaking the law blatantly being called out on it). I've even had a group of indigenous kids try and beat me up coz I wasn't one of them and had been excluded from things because I'm not indigenous. It's two sided. I don't give a shit what anyone says, I've experienced it from indigenous people. I wasn't wronging anyone, I didn't have it coming. How is it fair that I'm painted a racist when I've been the victim not the perpetrator? All of the holding onto old hurts and other experiences just makes people distrustful and resentful. Chewing down on old grudges and pain just breeds intolerance and hate. This is not to suggest that it shouldn't be acknowledged, what Australia did to its indigenous people but cramming it down everyone's collective throat is teaching people to be mistrustful. Use these events to bring people together and heal, not tell indigenous people that the whites are out to get them. I'm not the fucking boogeyman, my ancestors aren't from those generations, they're French and UK immigrants not from those times. I didn't do all that shit and nor do I condone it. To distrust and hate because of the colour of ones skin is racist no matter who the fuck you aim it at. Some accountability needs to fall where it belongs as well. Racism isn't just following people through shops assuming they're stealing, it's also assuming race is why you're followed because that person isn't indigenous and therefore has it in for you. Two sides to this coin people and until everyone acknowledges their own respective parts, we won't move forward. I will say this, and I loved the idea but couldn't go because of work, an indigenous government service group organised a 50's style dance night for indigenous people and white people to get together and have fun and have a good night. That needs to happen more. A little more love and a little less hate.

I think that about sums up my rant and observations of this issue and that stunning monologue that I hope drives home the point to many people. Racism is petty bullshit that can be fixed by coming together and understanding each other rather than being isolated from each other. I don't like humans in general because we're a shitty custodian of this planet and a generally shitty creature but the ones who don't wrong me don't get wronged by me irrespective of race, religion, cultural heritage or whatever else is unimportant when it comes to caring for one another.

289,gzg5vs,Refund run around,"I ordered a couple LEGO sets online during a promotional sale. The site looked legit, had the correct branding and everything. They were selling all sorts of LEGO sets including one that are hard to find or discontinued along with sets that I could find at my local store. I didn’t see anything indicating that they weren’t a legit website. 
I get an email the next day confirming my order. It listed the items and my total of $83.27. This number is important for later. 
4 days later I get an email saying that my items have shipped and I received a tracking number. I was able to track my package the entire 3 weeks that it took to get here from China. 
I checked my bank account and I was charged $87.43. I wasn’t too worried because it may have been tax or an international fee that would show up on the packing slip. 
Finally the tracking site says that my package was delivered. I check the mail and the only package I have is a small postal bag with a hat inside. It’s a black ball cap with Balenciaga embroidered on the bill. I don’t wear ball caps and I never would have ordered this one. 
I contacted customer service from my original email and told them I received the completely wrong item. They replied the next day and asked for pictures of the parcel and the item I received. They checked into it and discovered that the shipping company put my label on the wrong parcel. They then asked if I would like them to resend my items. Of course I said yes. 
2 days later they replied saying that the items were out of stock because of the sale but included a link so I could choose replacements. I looked and wasn’t interested in anything they had. I told them so and requested a refund. 
They replied by asking me to reconsider picking replacement items. I again said no and asked for a refund. I informed them that it was bad customer service to not give the customer what they request. I believe my request to be very reasonable. I didn’t receive my items, so I am entitled to a refund. 
Today they reply and tell me that they will refund my money but because they shipped out my items they lost stock and shipping costs so they would only offer me a 30% refund. 
I informed them that 30% is unacceptable. Their loss is not my problem and I should not be expected to cover their losses. They can take that up with the shipping company since it was their fault I didn’t receive my items. 
I have had this happen with other online orders before and I always received a full refund or the item I ordered and a return shipping label for the wrong item that I received. 
I would understand not getting a full refund if I was making a return. Amazon asks for return shipping and a restocking fee but I usually get a 50% or more refund after those charges depending on the item. In this case I was not making a return. I didn’t receive the items I ordered at all. 
I’m calling my bank and disputing the charge. Also because I never received the correct packing slip I can say that I was charged the incorrect amount. 
I have an email with one total amount but was charged a different total amount. There’s no proof of why my account was charged more than I was told in the confirmation email.",1591678003.0,2

I know I shouldn’t be flying right now, but I’ve been quarantining in preparation to go see him. I live alone and am not an essential worker, and he’s in the military where they don’t care if you’re sick or not they just want you to wear a mask and keep going. I was supposed to see him for the first time in a long time when covid started and I was crushed but we waited and things aren’t bad in my small town and there’s no cases in his group of whatever they’re called. I’m flying out on the 18, and this afternoon he sends me a picture of his car and it looks bad. Like if it’s not totaled I can’t imagine they can fix it in 9 days. I am going to contact the airport after I talk to him tonight but I can’t cancel my tickets. I’ll probably have to Uber to my hotel and instead of him being able to stay with me for a week and drive to work for the one or two days he couldn’t get off, I’ll probably end up sleeping alone so he can sleep and work on base and hopefully he can Uber or his friend can take him to stay with me on the weekend for a bit. 

The tickets were a birthday gift from my mom, and I have had a very bad history with my birthday so we don’t celebrate on my actual birthday and my mom tried really hard to get me something I would love.

All this. All the resources I used. All the time I put in. All the sleep I lost. Only to receive a message from my sister, telling me that she was up all night and that we weren't going, because she was ""tired and feeling a little sick"" feeling a little sick my ass.

301,gx6r8j,Just want to rant about a guy,"Hey everyone. I’ve just had quite a bit on my mind and I just feel like I need to vent somewhere. Sorry if this post becomes long and sorry if my thoughts seem all over the place.

So, a couple months ago when the quarantine started, I decided to download Tinder to start talking to people because I was bored and I thought it would be fun to talk to new people. I really didn’t have any plans on trying to meet guys to pursue a relationship, but if I did match with a guy and we just clicked, then I wouldn’t be opposed to dating them. So I ended up matching with this one guy who I will call Jim. I messaged him first to start the conversation. He messages me back and we talk for a bit on the app. After a few messages he asked for my Instagram and made a joke about wanting to slide into my DMs, so I gave him my username.

We added each other on Insta and we continued the conversation there. Out of all the guys I’ve matched with on Tinder, Jim is the one I feel the most attracted to. Jim has made the most effort to try and talk to me. Instead of ending the conversation, he would ask me a question so he can learn more about me. We don’t talk 24/7, but he would usually sends me a few messages a day. There were a few times where he wouldn’t get back to me for a few days, but it never bothered me because he would message me back and I realized he wasn’t going to leave me hanging in the convo. This realization grew even stronger when he messaged me after a week of not hearing from him to tell me that he was really focused on a project and that he wasn’t ignoring me. This really meant a lot to me since I’ve had numerous experiences with friends and other guys who would stop talking to me mid conversation and never message me back. With Jim, it really seemed like he was interested in me.

We talked on Instagram for about 2 months and then 2 weeks ago we ended up video calling each other for the first time. We talked for over an hour and I felt like it went amazingly. He even said he enjoyed talking to me and would want to do it again. He was really fun to talk to and he made me feel cute, respected, and special.  The way we conversed with each other it seemed like both of us wanted our relationship to go somewhere. He talked about how we could take naps together, how he would send me letters if the Army deployed him out of the country, and he even said he would be down to visit me once I move out of state for my new job. At the end of the conversation, he mentioned that his roommates were having a small get together at their place and he wanted me to come. He said he would message me the next day with the info and i could tell him if I would be able to go or not. We end the video call and both go to bed.

The next day, I sent him a link to a video I said I would send him and was waiting to hear the info about the party. He didn’t say anything. I was a little sad that he never messaged me about it, but it didn’t really bother me because I didn’t think it would be a good idea to go to a hang during this pandemic especially while still living at home with my parents. About a week goes by and he still hadn’t said anything to me. However, he is still posting stuff on his insta story and he is still viewing my stories. I did respond to one of his stories last week and he sent me back a reply. I sent a message to his reply and he has still not responded to the message.

Maybe I’m over reading things, but I’m starting to feel like maybe he’s not interested anymore. Since the video call he hasn’t said anything to me, not even a message letting me know he’s busy. I’m trying not to message him because I don’t want to sound desperate, but I am starting to wonder if something about the conversation didn’t sit right with him or maybe he met another girl on Tinder he’s more interested in. He is still following me on Instagram which I feel is a good sign since most Tinder guys have unfollowed me once they lost interest. However, I’m getting so stressed about him unfollowing me that I check my account everyday to see if he’s still following me. Before the video call, Jim and I agreed that we wanted to hang out with each other before I move out of state. I was planning on messaging him about hanging out this coming week but now I’m not even sure if I should.

Long story short: Met a guy on Tinder that I’m really starting to like. Had consistent conversations for the 2 months but haven’t heard anything the past 2 weeks. Not really sure what’s going on or what I should do.",1591371119.0,1
302,gx6fn7,Americans messed up.,"Yes, it's everywhere in your face with black squares and black icons etc. I'm gonna bitch about America and we're all likely tired of it by now but I'm gonna do it anyway.

I agree that the black community should be up in arms and outraged over what's happened there. I agree with protesting and demanding justice. What I don't agree with is looting and rioting. Those acts have undermined everything people are trying to do with peaceful protests. Everyone who has rioted and looted has just set the black cause further back as the media and anti-black organisations will use that to paint the cause in a bad light. There's some bad white people (and a lot of them) out there who have been training, arming and stockpiling for a race war and everyone (I know it's been all races) who has participated in violence, destruction and looting are giving them a reason to start more violence and kick off a race war that they desperately want. The media will use all this to create more fear. Fear is big business, fear keeps people tuning in and spending money, clicking links and all the shit they need to make more money. The times that it's the hardest to maintain composure and control yourself are usually the times that it's most important. If there ever was a time where a new black leader who is smart, patient, observant and savvy to step up to the plate, now is the time.

What I also don't agree with is people jumping on the bandwagon like in Australia where people are falsely claiming police brutality on an Aboriginal dude who threatened to attack a police officer. The police officer use a simple take down method to restrain the guy and not using excessive force but everyone is jumping on the police. It will be seen that he didn't even let the guy hit the ground with full force either.

Stupidity spreads globally it seems. Don't loot, don't riot, follow legal courses of action to demand justice and for the love of all things sacred, don't diminish somebody else's struggle by trying to make it your own.",1591370054.0,5
303,gx55j4,GENERAL complaint about WHATEVER THE HECK this BS IS," 

Wasn't it just a year or two ago when thigh gaps were a thing so coveted by women that they were getting surgery just so that their inner thighs wouldn't touch? I remember thinking that was kind of crazy because a lot of people I know would look weird if they had a big thigh gap. It just only looks natural on certain people.

But NOW APPARENTLy That's not cool anymore-- being ""thick"" is cool and having bigger hips and butt and thighs which is nearly impossible to have that and a small stomach... LET ALONE THAT AND A THIGH FREAKING GAP

BUT NOoOoOoOoOoOW , we have to not have HIP DIPS??? Fuxking EXCUSE me? Since when is it not okay to have hip dips? That's literally just a natural thing where the fat on your hips that literally every girl has is pushed in a little bit because there's A FREAKING BONE THERE, BRO.

And now poor girls are beside themselves trying to do workouts to fill in that dip when I'm pretty sure that's not even anatomically possible bc I don't think there are such thing as HIP MUSCKLES so we just gonna add it to the ever more impossible list of things girls are told they have to have:

1.No stomach fat (which is necessary by the way to PROTECT YOUR FREAKING ORGANS,)

2. big hips and butt (which is nearly impossible to have when you don't have a bigger tummy)

3. THE THIGH GAP

They tried to hold a protest then cancelled it for some reason then asked people not to attend a protest if it was led by a white person. The whole thing was weird and messy. I asked why they don't want a protest led by a white person? I didn't know if there was a policy or what. No one got back to me. So I asked the BLM Reddit and basically got chewed out for asking black people to ""educate me"" and then had my post removed. Maybe a kind, ""hey this Reddit isn't for those types of questions here's a link to some place you can find that info."" It's really off putting as someone who is trying to be supportive and do the right thing to be bitch slapped for trying to be supportive. 

I hate this mentality of ""I don't have to educate you."" To some extent, yes you do!

310,gw97f8,Culturally Conflicted,"So. I’m conflicted to even post this kind of post with what is going on politically right now. #BlackLivesMatter #StopPoliceBrutality

After work today, I went to support the revolution at graffitied monuments in my city. I was sitting in my car with the door open putting on shoes. I was in a bright colored shirt leaning outside of the car and locking eyes with a car with 2 black ladies in it as they drove by. They ended up intentionally hit their side mirror on the door where I was sitting. There was more than enough space on the road for them to scoot over a foot and nobody else on the road for them to avoid. 

As this happened, I admittedly stood up and asked what the fuck was wrong with them when they stopped at a stop sign only 1/4 of the block down. 

I am straight off the boat Latinx on my fathers side but look white at a glance. 

They told me to get of the road, to which I answered that I was there for them and this was a night for love(as the monuments were announced to be removed only hours prior). They proceeded to say they didn’t see me (in an obvious lying tone). 

I’m confused and conflicted because as a POC that looks white I feel like I was targeted. I know black people have been targeted for far too long and feel as if this was lingering anger. But fighting police brutality then coming to do me intentional harm is counterproductive in my opinion. Especially as someone there to support and amplify the voice. 

I’m confused and conflicted because I feel like I had to justify that I am also POC and my family had to fight but my skin isn’t dark enough for people to know that without asking. (I didn’t actually say it in the moment but deep inside me I want to YELL IT on the top of my lungs.)

I’m confused and conflicted because I feel like I’m not allowed to speak up about my heritage because it’s a Black Lives movement. 

I’m confused and conflicted because I feel like I look too white to show value to the latinx crowd. 

I’m confused and conflicted because it’s not the time for me to voice my hardships and I don’t know who else to go to besides an anonymous platform with strangers. 

I’m sorry and thank you for hearing me out.",1591240913.0,4
311,gvj8km,I got stung in the face by a wasp while trying to kill a venomous snake,"My dog was freaking out so I went outside to check it out. Found him barking at a snake that I identified as a cottonmouth. I dragged my dog inside and decided to kill it in case he got bit. Even though I know it was a cottonmouth I knew that the vet would prefer I have a specimen for them. I live in the suburbs where it’s illegal to discharge a firearm and I didn’t want to get close enough to use a machete. I decided that my best bet was to use a pellet gun. I went out and found the snake. I proceeded to shoot it in the head with the air rifle. I hit it and it wriggled in pain. I shot it again in hopes of finishing it quickly. I hit it again but this time it retreated into a thick bush. I tried to get it out by throwing sticks into the bush. As I did so i heard a buzzing in my right ear followed by a sharp pain right behind my eye. We have wasps here, lots of wasps. So I immediately knew that it was a wasp of some sort. It’s been an hour and, quite fortunately, my dog isn’t showing any signs of invenomization from the snake. And I have an emergency vet with anti venom on call just in case. But boy does my face hurt. I guess I’ll have to find the snake or ensure it’s gone for good before I let my mutt out tomorrow. And I actually feel really bad for the snake.

313,gv2ocv,Mental health support groups are full of drama.,"I have bipolar and I've been participating in a weekly support group meeting in my area. The group is peer run and is part of a larger organization that is also peer run. I have found a lot of healing in the meeting I attend. Our facilitator is great and even though she has her personal struggles she has great interpersonal skills and is an awesome communicator. 

The other organization members in the area have a tendency to be very dramatic and immature. (Some of these people are clear into their 70s.) There's a FB group for the area to make it easier to communicate about monthly activities and stuff like that. It's often full of drama. 

This afternoon one woman in the group, whom I've only ever met over zoom, and I'm not really close to by any means, posted in the FB group about how it had been four whole days since her surgery and not a single person from the group had bothered to check on her. She bitched about how she's clearly not important to any of us and other people's properties were other places.

I just ignored it. I don't know her well enough to bother messaging her or leaving a comment. But what I WOULD like to say is that no one is anyone elses priority. None of these people HAVE to check on you. Would it have been nice, or kind? Sure. But it's not a requirement to do that, even if you care about someone. She's just guilt tripping everyone to get attention!! 

What gets me is that another woman from the group had her grandmother die last week, her parents came into town, she lost her job, and her car broke down but she was still apologizing for not checking on this other woman. Someone else in the group also ended up having surgery last week, one person checked themselves into to the mental hospital for suicidal ideation, and another person was incredibly ill and almost ended up in the hospital as well. Some people have jobs and families to care for. Personally I was spending time with family while out of town and belong my mom with her own surgery. And on top of it, a lot of these people lost jobs and income because of Covid. It's just annoyingly selfish and immature of this woman to demand she be considered anyone's priority. I would hope her family is there for her and maybe some other close friends but this is stupid. Come on lady!!

317,gutv82,The Internet is going in a shit direction; fuck Google,"Just now I tried to log in to an old social media account to make some comments as I had years before on that account, but apparently I hadn't verified my email. Never used to be an issue before, but whatever, easy fix. I log in to the old Google account attached, perfectly recalling my username and password, but that's not enough. I have to input the censored recovery email to verify. Annoying, but no issue; I still have access to the account. I recall it perfectly, but that's still not enough. Now they need my phone number, so they can send a code. Thing is, **I never had a phone number linked on that account in the first place**! I try not to link my accounts and personal info if at all, so I press the ""Try another way"" button, thinking they'll just send that code through my recovery email, which I had specifically specified for just such an occasion. But they don't. It just refreshes the same prompt asking for my phone number, something they've never had. They aren't trying to verify my identity, which they could easily do by sending that exact same code to my listed recovery email. They're trying to get my phone number. 

If you've been operating on the edge of anonymity for a while you'll notice that anonymous access has been limited more and more in recent years, often in subtle ways. Like how you can't make YouTube playlists (even private for your own browsing) anymore unless your YT account is attached to a verified (through phone) Google account or if you create your own brand channel. Or how the Google Play Store sends me offers of free credits that I could claim by putting some credit card information on my account, whereas my boyfriend, whose account already has payment info, gets nothing. Or how you can't uninstall Microsoft People, Xbox Console Companion, or Groove Music (formerly Zune) even if you don't use them. Or that you need third-party software just to stop Cortana from listening all the god damn time. There's just no way to exist online or even offline without some company somewhere taking in some form of data about you, even if you're wary about it. This is quite deliberate. The failures of SOPA and PIPPA demonstrate that legislation does not represent the public interest, but the interests of data giants whose massive economy is built on the uncontested pilfering of private data. With every tech company racing to link up to every possible consumer, Google and Microsoft buying up all the smaller third-party tech companies to consolidate their services (Zune, Skype, etc.) and advertising giants taking up massive market share through peddling personal data alone, there's fewer and fewer cyberspaces that don't require you to give up your identity to use. 

I get it. Bots are bad. Especially in public forums where the volume of your opinion often trumps its quality. But there are ways to safeguard against this without railroading all your users into giving up their personal info. Sure it's easy for bots to make accounts, but the OG spambot isn't online, it's a retro autodialer. Assuming only real humans use phone numbers is as stupid as assuming only real humans can use email. But that's not important. Because that's not what these policies are about. They aren't trying to weed out bots and fraud, they're just trying to track every consumer. They're just trying to map the well-established telecom infrastructure onto the newer, 'anonymous' comms network that is the internet. Training the new pup with old tricks. I'm fucking sick of this.

People have lost their jobs and loved ones and I am very lucky by comparison. In a lot of ways the quarantine has even been a blessing for me. Because I'm home more now I was able to get much more done than if I had to go into work. That being said I'm starting to feel like I'm at my wits' end.

A few weeks ago we noticed my cat Arlo was limping a bit. He's a little older so we assumed he had hurt his leg jumping down from to high or something. The vet informed us that it was because he had developed cancer in his foot due to a cancer infection in his lungs. Arlo is my favorite cat of the two we have. We bonded pretty strong and it sounds dumb but he's one of my best buds. And now I have to watch him die.

Now, we've recently moved into a house, and as such we have blown through a bunch of money. Movers, new furniture, the whole thing. We've always lived in apartments so this is kind of a big deal for us. My wife has been ""nesting"" pretty hard too, as I said we basically got all new furniture. Admittedly the place is looking great but as more and more furniture and tchotchkes show up I'm getting increasingly worried about our finances. I love my wife but she's a stress buyer and with the move and my cats failing health I'm a little concerned that she'll go to far. She says it's fine and honestly since she's the primary earner in the house there's not much I can say without causing an argument. It's just that all this new stuff plus the vet bills and Arlo's medication in my head it's all piling up. Medication I might add Arlo won't even take (the little jerk.).

So about a week ago Arlo stopped eating. I assumed it was because of his pain meds since loss of appetite and lethargy are some of the side effects of both of the meds the vet prescribed. Also can I talk about that for a second? What kind of medication for a dying animal basically stops them from taking it? How does that work?! It's the classic joke of the side effects being as bad as the thing you're treating! But anyway, because of this (and my wife being home all day) our cats feeding schedule is all out of whack. There are, at any time of day, at least three bowls of food on the floor. This has messed our other cat Conrad completely up. He is a finicky eater and will not even touch food that is a few minutes old. So we've basically created an annoyance loop of putting food out for the cats Arlo look at it and wander sadly back to bed, Conrad will take 3 bites ofp the old food then start screaming at us to put down new food that he will then take 3 bites of and then walk away from and then on occasion he will eat to much to fast and just barf it all up so now he's hungry again! We thought putting crunchy food out would help because then they could graze and we wouldn't have to keep opening cans. But that's a no go either we just end up back in the same place. In fact I'm currently typing this in the bathroom because he has been whining and head butting me none stop for 20mins even though there's are two plates of new food on the floor for him right now. I just don't know what to do with these animals they are driving me nuts.

I just don't know what to do. My wife is constantly stressed out or crying. She keeps reading all these articles about pet death and such and just getting more upset about it. I've tried to convince her to stop but she's says it helps her to know what to expect. She keeps asking me to call the vet every time she reads a new thing, I wouldn't be surprised at this point if they just stopped taking my calls. On top of all that there's just general chores and maintenance that comes with a new house and getting everything set up. For a solid week there was nothing I did except assembling furniture then going to bed. Life just feels so relentless right now.

No moment of silence has lasted long without being interrupted by cat screaming or my wife calling me to do something. I would love just a week to just turn my brain off and play games on my phone or watch tv in peace. I don't know. 

Not sure how to end this, just stay safe out there and take it easy internet.",1590750924.0,2

333,grt87x,Reddit is an oozing fistula,"The community here on Reddit is disgustingly intolerant, overly sensitive and touchy, so much so that any comment section here, as well as some of the r/ subs remind me of abscess leaking from a gangrenous wound.

Bertrand Russell said very concisely in this video ( [A conversation with Bertrand Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb3k6tB-Or8) ) that people are simply going to have to accept the fact that many do not think like them or share their views.

But here on Reddit, like on so many other places on the internet which are densely populated with uncivilized plebeians, people make a point of decrying anyone who doesn't **already** think like them.

Discussion is the foundation of civilization and, funnily enough, is also it's main tool of dissemination. If you have a more civilized way of tackling the problems of existence, polite conversation is the best way to convince other to imitate your behaviour.

Instead of that, we have only childish criticizing which I guess could be likened to putting up a one-way mirror, so as to only show the faults in others without actually demonstrating how you yourself behave, which would help to spread the correct behaviour as you see it. The binary voting system here, as it usually does everywhere, doesn't actually reflect the merit of the thing being downvoted. Instead it merely shows how many people have opinions which differ from the original poster/commentator. As if truth relies upon how many people ascribe to it (it doesn't, btw),

Another thing that truly astonishes me, and I honestly can not understand how it is allowed, is the r/iamatotalpieceofshit sub. People publish private information, even pictures of people, pretending like they are doing society a great service, as if they are qualified to pass judgement on others. This is nothing but gossip, unsubstantiated, and as utterly unhelpful and without benefit to the world as the actions of the people they advertise as total pieces of shit. As Nietzsche said, ""he who fights with monsters should take care, lest they find themselves become one"".

An infection on the surface is spreading across the whole of Reddit, demanding uniformity and appropriating power. Learning about things from other humans across the world is difficult to do on Reddit, because you have to wade through so much filth and hateful responses. Simply put, the notion of improved communication (one of the main benefits of having the internet in the first place) is being eroded from Reddit.

I have a suggestion for at least one improvement which is easy to make: remove downvoting. Since it's harder to represent the spectrum of opinion and emotions, just make the voting genuinely binary. Remember, binary is only 1 or 0, something or nothing. Either you like it, or you don't. After all, it isn't like you have three voting options, 'like', 'dislike', and 'meh, idgaf'. Innovation may be difficult, but this one solution is at least relatively simple and perfectly tenable.

358,gp7ado,Ad oversaturation is detrimental to the ad market,"So Yahoo email recently implemented a strange policy where they revert you back to the old ""basic"" interface if you're using adblock because the new interface features (which I've been using with adblock for over a year) are now not compatible with adblock. Don't see how an emails interface is directly linked with an adblock app, but sure. This is a strange attempt at trying to push users to whitelist yahoo so they can make some money. To which I say, go fuck yourself Yahoo.

Some sites tell you right off the bat they need ads for revenue, so please turn off your adblock. Which I respect, I can understand that. Other places offer you to pay to remove ads entirely (e.g. streaming services), which I can also respect. The issue though isn't the ads in the first place, but how they're implemented. The greed and excess of ads is the only reason adblock exists. It's the constant pop ups of ads blocking your ability to read an article (looking at you webmd and every blog in existence), the frequent long unskippable ads of youtube (remember when you only had 1 30 second ad you could skip after 4 seconds), the flashing casino style ads littering the entire site you're visiting giving you eye seizures.

You go on youtube for a few hours, check out various sites/blogs, check your email, search shit up, etc. Meanwhile, adblock is up the entire time, causing all the youtubers and sites to lose out on money. Sure, sometimes I remember to turn it off, but more often than not, I forget. The more you push, the more people push back. You create more and more ads to make up for lost revenue, and those that don't have adblock, start to implement it more. People are more willing to pay for subscription based services, because they are willing to pay for uninterrupted ad-free content. People cutting back on tv, and gearing more towards streaming services. Personally, I stopped watching tv cause I was just tired of all the ads. A 2 hour movie turns into 3-4 hours due to ads, and you get interrupted every 5-10 minutes of the movie. You're saying for just a couple bucks a month I can actually watch my shit in peace? Without getting bombarded by ads every other minute? Take my money!

The ad market needs to change if it wants to survive. The recent development of gathering info on users to try and gear more relevant ads, is a step in the right direction, but its not enough. Having youtubers sponsor your product by tying it into their video and putting a fun twist on it is also good, but again its not enough. They need to revamp their entire model, and stop stubbornly following the old jaded model of simply bombarding your customers with ads 24/7. It makes people stop visiting your site/service, and gears them towards more subscription based platforms where they will pay money to literally just watch/listen to their shit in peace. And if it wasn't clear, I want the ad market to survive, I think it provides a lot of jobs/money to people.",1590249408.0,4

Well, I tell ya; I remember being a teen and putting up with this constant berating from every adult; be it teachers, people I worked with, or even my own damn parents. It annoyed the fuck out of me, putting up with these constant positive berating from all angles. Heck, even the radio, online blogs, the news, movies, tv shows, etc, etc treats teens this way. It's a deep seeded cultural norm that everyone thinks is an okay, amusing, and necessary coming-of-age milestone. I can remember quite clearly that it sometimes hurt to be treated like a different species from the adults. That's why you see teens going off on a tantrum; the typical teen you see flaunted all over media.

The cause for this behaviour I can almost guarantee is because we, as adults, don't know how to treat teens. We treat them like children because it would be strange for us to treat them any other way. But what we don't understand is this is a tumultuous time in their lives, they're developing emotionally and they're more vulnerable in this state. Teens can be hurt by our berating of them, treating them like they're the ""that teen \*rolls eyes\*"" that every adult seems to behave towards teens.

I'm not saying we should treat them like adults. I'm saying we just need to make this cultural norm of teasing teens to stop. We need to respect their developing feelings and we need to protect those feelings. This is like a type of bullying and unfortunately, teens laugh it off and go along with it because they don't know better.

Anyway, rant over. Thanks for listening.",1589827663.0,13

I have had a catastrophic situation which, among other thing, caused me to suffer a minor episode due to the stress generated by LORENA and staff.

Here is a brief summary:

**On friday I bought the product because their website stated ""pick up in-store today”.**  
**I paid, received a confirmation email and went to the store some hours later to pick it up. Upon arriving, although I saw the product I ordered (through the glass door), I was treated with** **hostility and had the door slammed on my face. A grotesque episode of** **humiliation** **in from too many clients gathered in from of your store.**   
**Your people, under a certain LORENA refused to give me the item that I had bought (and payed for) because I had to receive another email and she would not help at all.**    
**The confirmation email attached was not good enough. ALSO they wouldn’t look at the proof of payment.**   
**Then one employee comes outside (no masks or gloves) and says my order was canceled. I didn’t authorize ANYBODY todo that, but it was done without my consent.**   
**Saturday at 8:00 I tried your chatline for explanations and, instead I fell victim to the company’s farse.**   
**TOMMY WINTERS EXT 3323, GUARANTEED I would be able to to pick it up at the same store in 30 minutes. See evidence attached.**   
**PLEASE NOTE THE REPEATED PROMISE ON THE CHATSCRIPTS ATTACHED.**   
**At 3:00PM (6 hours later) I head to the store just to hear another barrage of lies. They dismissively ignored me and after that wasn’t amusing anymore they sent me home…** **EMPTY HANDED AND HUMILIATED FOR THE 3RD TIME.**   
**The reason was they didn’t have the item, although I could see the product sitting inside the store. I call GC and I was told by DARLA that this is COMMOM PRACTICE at Guitar Center and that the chat person** **lied to get a comission on the sale. Note that I was humiliated, treated like dirt, I was put on eternal holds just to have the call miraculously ""dropped"" after 2 hours constantly. Today I went online again to find the same item being sold at the same store. I opened a chat under a different name and inquired about the item and the availability and The same tactic was used, I was GUARANTEED PICK UP IN 30 MINUTES if I paid immediately. Once I revealed my name and requested an explanation, the assistant hung up on my face. This is NOT FAIR, the institution is CLEARLY using  ILLEGAL tactics to scam online users. And to top it off, The manager offered to give me the item if I would accept a floor model.  said no. And then the next day back on the chatline I was told the unit in SHERMAN OAKS store was BRAND-NEW and ready to pick up. I demand an explanation as to how this institution is allowed to embezzle and deceive consumers this way. And without ANY consequences.**

Shift in management and it’s all about the numbers/profit and no longer about compassion and families. 



1. I was asked to add more to my plate without compensation and met with a snarky remark by HR. 

2. I used to clock into work from 630-630 but now they want to to be exactly 7-7. Which is fine but annoying because we used to do the 630 because I was releasing the previous person on shift and there wasn’t someone to release me so I didn’t think it would be a big deal.

3. I chose to help a coworker and it backfired. Basically she told me it was “not cool” but I wanted to save her some extra work so I just did it for her. She never communicated so I didn’t know what was being done on the case. 

4. It’s almost like you have to know who to help, who you have to ask if they need help and others just leave them alone. And it’s impossible to keep straight. There’s also no win/win because it’s mostly either be annoying and hound people to help them which gets me in trouble or sit back and do nothing and get in trouble for not helping...

My MIL is losing her goddamned mind and I have no sympathy for her because she refuses to accept that she needs help.

The other night she was all wobbly and stumbling and confused and if you didn't know her you would have sworn she was drunk. She doesn't drink. So either she was having a stroke, showing some early onset dementia, or she took too many pills. The next morning we checked on her and she got angry and defensive and said she was ""acting like that on purpose""

Because of this pandemic we're trapped here with her.
She leaves the burners on on the stove, she flooded the yard, left the sink running, leaves her car doors wide open. She's gotten so forgetful.
She seems bipolar. She'll tell us we can have some of the dinner she cooked and then the next morning berate my husband for eating some and tell him that she pays for ""everything"".

I've started just packing all of my stuff up little by little. I'm just going to buy disposable dishes and we're not going to eat anything we didn't buy.
She tells my husband that he's the most hateful person she knows. He has been patient and tolerant and accepting of all of this abuse from her. (Incoming: run on sentence) But because he can't make ALL of the trash fit into the trash can the night before trash pick up and because he won't move the vacuum to one side of the room and then vacuum the side of the room she asked him to move the vacuum from as he needs to get the baby ready for bed and because we won't take our baby to a surprise pool party during a pandemic he's evil, ungrateful, and the most hateful person she had ever met.

My SIL is one of my best friends and I've approached her about what's going on. I know she has a lot going on in her life but her daughters visit here often so I believe she has a right to know about her mother's behaviors and antics. SIL tells me that she knows she needs to talk to her mother about her health and that she had tried talking to her about selling the house and moving into a MIL suite at their home but tells me that she knows things are difficult, especially with this pandemic, but the only way anything will change is if we move out. My SIL refuses to acknowledge that something is wrong.
So we're doing what we can to get our ducks in a row and we're going to leave ASAP.
MIL will not get to see our baby until she is in a situation where she has supervision from another adult.

I work your standard 40 hour week, 7am to 3.30pm Mon-Fri. 

I live next to the lounge and kitchen as stated in the title (in the only bedroom upstairs) , 2 new flatmates moved in a few months ago, and they're as inconsiderate as heck!

I woke up in the first week of them being here at 1am on a Wednesday to doof doof doof of bass and opened my door to about 10 drunk people in the lounge. To their credit they did all leave when I asked them to keep the noise down and while they've had people noise since (before lockdown) it hasn't been as loud or as late. I pointed out at this point that the walls are extremely thin so you can hear everything. 

My new flatmates are international students studying their masters and call home, but they do so very loudly between 1 and 3am. They often have the volume turned right up for these calls too, as well as for videos they watch and games they play. After a week or two of being woken up from this I asked them to please use headphones after 11pm - hard to say but I'd have to call it 50/50 on whether they do or not. Headphones don't really help that much if you're yell talking down the phone anyway. 

They also cook very late at night, usually between 9.30 and 11.30pm, but I'm awake now at 1.50am because it sounded like someone was drumming on the bench in the kitchen, turned out it was just one of them cutting vegetables. They often bang and crash in the kitchen too. 
I try to be zen about the kitchen noise because I take it as being part and parcel of living next to the kitchen - who am I to dictate when you can and cannot use the kitchen in your own home - but man, some awareness would be awesome.

This is all stuff that I've brought up to them, and they have improved (slightly), but honestly it's annoying to even have to tell a fully grown adult that the middle of the night is not a good time to be noisy. I've lived with plenty of other people in this flat while being in the same room and I've been woken up on and off, but these guys it's basically every night, often multiple times a night.

Unfortunately we're all equal on the lease so I can't actually kick them out, just have to continue talking to them and hoping they'll eventually be more self aware and considerate.",1589206127.0,4

     I've been in the mood to complain for months, but I generally try not to complain, because it doesn't solve any problems... But I think I'm at peak mood to complain.

     I don't trust ""charming"" people, aka narcissists and psychopaths. They creep me out, especially with how they can manipulate people. Charisma itself is a fine trait, but when everything about them screams ""charming,"" it's just unnatural in a sense. They're attractive, they're rich, they make you feel good about yourself, and yet you know hardly anything about them. They don't let people close, or if they do, they don't stay long. They play it off like they were a gold digger, or a liar, but in reality, they're just a master manipulator.

     Then there's a breed of manipulator under the guise of a feminist. They say women are better than men, and they need to be protected, but then they get mad if their woman isn't the epitome of feminine. They can't even handle it if a woman says ""bro."" They say these things usually to get ""broken"" women to manipulate. They're so good at drawing women in, and coming off as a savior, just to end up being so creepy. I've met a few like this, and it's so bizzare talking to them.

     Then we have ""nice guys."" They use their low self esteem as ways to complain about not being ""Chads,"" and are just so weird. They don't realize that they view women as sex objects instead of, oh my gosh! People? Then they get mad when they're rejected, because how dare and object reject them?

     There are so many dudes like this in the dating scene. There's also the kind that insult you if you reject them, or the ones that want to ""worship"" you, but only for one night. Then you better leave! That worship wasn't girlfriend material, but rather one night stands with a ""goddess"" material. It's all so weird! 

     A lot of amazing people in my life are single, and honestly I see why. It's so hard to find a person that isn't creepy in the dating scene. Once you find that, then you have to actually be compatible, which you rarely are, at least for the long haul. I just really want myself, and my friends to end up in healthy, happy relationships.

     None of us even ask for much. The bar is basically on the ground, and it's still so hard. We just want to be with people who respect us, want a family, and our hobbies/world views to mostly link up. Looks aren't important to any of us. By society's standards, I at the very least am not a model by any means, so it wouldn't be fair to ask for the picture perfect dude... But a lot of my friends are honestly 10/10 beauties, and have amazing personalities! I have no idea how they haven't found amazing people to be with.

     I dunno, maybe I really am picky and just don't realize it? I don't think I am though. I'm not asking for someone who's incredibly attractive, or rich, or good in bed... I want to be with someone who I can laugh with every day, and we love our day to day life. We're a great team, and we're just generally happy together. I do admit I'd rather he has a decent paying job, but that's because my particular career choice isn't known for being financially the best unless I get really lucky. I just don't want money to be such an intense issue for us you know?",1589185927.0,1
399,ghevas,Trying to find a house sucks.,"Single mom (23). Down payment saved up, preapproved before Corona. Since Rona lenders have gotten stricter. Still approved, but worse interest rates. Okay, sucks but oh well. Here’s my issues. 

There’s nothing in my budget available in my county or surrounding counties, that anywhere meet my wish list. I’ve been living back with my parents for a year and a half. I’m going nuts y’all. Champagne taste on a beer budget apparently. Guess I gotta buckle in and keep saving. I’m just frustrated with the feelings I’m having. I can’t even find a word for it. Suffocation, irritable, fidgety, unsettled, short tempered. These aren’t feelings I know how to remedy other than getting out. I refuse to rent. I refuse to waste money on buying a home to just run away. I’ll end up so much more unhappy and stuck. Fuuuudge. 

The end.

407,ga7mu3,Just annoyed and need to vent...,"I work overnight as a hotel auditor. Even though the government doesn't specifically list my job as an essential business, we do fall under the shelter category. I live in a small city, but my hotel is constantly packed. 
Because hockey is no longer being played, the weekends are empty, but during the week every single week out of the year we are at least half capacity with railroad workers. 
I'm usually tasked with making breakfast and making sure it is set up and watching it for an hour until the front desk person gets here in the mornings. That's fine, I have no problem with that. It is a little frustrating though on one specific day because that's when all the railroad workers check out and I have to work front desk duties as well as check on breakfast for about 60 people and make sure it is constantly full. 
Since covid-19, we are not allowed to serve hot breakfast. We have moved to bagged breakfast. Every single morning I have to make paper bags with granola bars cookies and a wrapped spoon, then make sure muffins or pastries are wrapped and put out, boiled eggs are each individually wrapped, and make sure there is juice and fruit stocked at all times. These guys always come in at about the same time, and all together.
Even though we have notes posted all over the place including as you get out of the elevator stating to please take your breakfast and leave with it as we are not supposed to have anyone sitting in the breakfast bar, they consistently do. Management just shrugs their shoulders at it and says well, they're going to do it anyway. Not to mention half the time the workers come in at least 30 minutes before breakfast is supposed to be set out and start going through stuff that I have set out already regardless if the doors are shut and the lights are off.
 I have back problems already and me standing there individually wrapping at least 40 eggs in the morning and then muffins as well and putting bags together really is starting to wear on me. I know I can't really complain because this is not a normal situation, but this is not what I signed up to do. These workers travel from the neighboring state every single week and stay here. I am not only risking my health, but I have three children at home. 
I don't even get a thank you, and nobody mentions the hotel workers who are still working and risking getting sick. I do very much appreciate the healthcare workers and grocery store workers, my daughter actually works at Walmart and is still working right now. I guess I'm just frustrated that if I would have gotten laid off I would have gotten the extra $600 a week payment which ends up being almost what I take home every two weeks. As it is right now I still get my regular pay, nothing extra,  no thanks,  and vacation time is banned right now so I can't even take a day off if I wanted, even though I have the vacation pay to cover it. I'm sick of hearing people crying that they got laid off from their job when they're sitting at home collecting more money than I'm even making. /rant",1588159249.0,4

My brother needed paper while I was out of the house, and since I have “the good paper,” he uses up all my watercolor paper on a math sheet. 

As work/doodling paper.

414,g9f9mc,What do you mean you don’t have a Coronavirus Special!?,"I work for a decent pizza restaurant. Granted, don’t get me wrong. I absolutely hate the establishment and my manager for reasons I won’t get into right now. Anyways, this takes place last week on a Sunday. 

For some backstory. Are restaurant has specials going on everyday of the week except Sunday. This is because a Sunday is such a high influx of dine-in customers that we usually do a buffet with free dine-in drinks. On average are location would run about $4700 between the hours of 11:30 a.m. and 2:45 p.m.. we open and 11. The store closes at 10 p.m. We also deliver all day from open to close. However due to the current pandemic going on are store has been extremely slow. We average about $1800 in sales for the whole day. Due to this we have been posting and advertising multiple types of specials through out the week for people to still get a decent meal for their whole family at a reasonable price. Nonetheless are store has still stuck to no specials on a Sunday. 
For legal reasons the store name has been changed to “billy bobs pizza”

The call.

It’s about 3:20 p.m. the only people in the store is the following: Me (Assistant Manager), a delivery driver, and a cook who has worked here for almost 15 years. The phone rings and as I pick it up and answer it with are normal response “ Thank you for calling Billy Bobs Pizza, this is so and so. Will this be for a carry out or a delivery?” The lady on the other end of the phone responded in a rather upset tone. “This is gunna be a take out order.”  I responded with “Okay, can I get a phone number starting with the area code first please?” After the lady give me her information I asked “What can I get for you today?” She immediately stated “I want your Coronavirus special that you have going on, you know the one with the free pizza and wings.” I simply stated “I’m sorry ma’am but this location doesn’t currently have a special like the one you described.” After a brief pause the lady starts ripping into me “ What the F*ck do you mean you don’t have a d*amn coronavirus Special during the hard times. There are people trying to feed their families with little money and no income and your just trying to take every d*amn penny you can from us.” This went on for roughly 8 or so minutes until the lady made it personal by stating “I bet your some walrus looking bucked tooth beaver piece of sh*t who is living of mommy and daddy’s money.” Now I’m a rather calm and collected person. I don’t think I’ve ever gone off on someone before in my life ( or at least that I can remember). I immediately thought “This dumb bitch doesn’t realize that I have her name, phone number, and address sitting in front of me on a screen clear as day. After a couple seconds passed I simply stated “Due to the way you have just treated the staff of this establishment you are here by banned from the premises and will no longer be able to order from us again. If any attempt is made to reach out to this establishment and or an attempt to place an order here we will automatically void the order. We have a record of all your previous orders along with your name, phone number, and address that will be put on a ‘watch list ‘. Should you ignore this charges may end up being filed against you.” Are phone lines are recorded for quality purposes and It even states that when you call. I am somewhat aware of all the rights I have as and assistant manager in are establishment and state. After the call when my GM showed up I notified him of everything and then reached out to the owner of are location. The owner thought it was hilarious.  Apparently after some quick research by my GM he found that this lady has been doing this to dozens of other stores in are town and several places have filed harassment charges against her as she has done it multiple times to them.

This complaint is simply me reviewing the facts and giving out my personal opinion based on them. If you disagree, that's fine, but I am ranting here for a reason.

So for those of you that don't know, RuPaul's Drag Race Season 12 has been at the peak of controversy surrounding some of the queens and we're only at week 6. There was a lot of controversy surrounding Aiden Zhane and Brita, Brita picking on Aiden, other queens joining in on picking on Aiden and naturally, the fans aren't happy with her. Naturally, people are talking shit about Brita, mostly in forums, but a little bit directed at her as well.

For the past 4 weeks, everyone and their mother has been talking about how they've hated Brita. Brita was being a bully and Brita knew it. Personally, I don't like bullies, others have been saying that they don't like bullies, others have been spewing hate across the board on Brita, calling her names, telling her to kill herself etc. and that's not cool.

Now, just days ago, she announced that she was taking a break from social media BECAUSE of all the hate and now, everyone and their mother is saying crap like ""Ohh you don't know what it's like, the edits are what made her like that, she's really nice in person!!"" What? SHUT UP. No, shut the fuck up. I swear to fucking god, you are the same fucking people who sat there and shat on her for bullying Aiden and now that she's gone, suddenly, you're uplifting her??

You all just sat there and got pissy with her in episode 5 because she did the same thing to Aiden.

It was about, well, the exact words were, ‘Supreme Master Ching Hai’s Urgent Call to Rescue our World and Pray for World Vegan’. Look, I don’t have a problem with vegans, but I have a problem with this ad and the things in it. 

1. ‘We are destroying this world’ We already know this.

2. ‘We are all going to Hell and not going to Heaven if we keep killing animals to eat’ Ok, animals kill other animals for food and we are animals. Stop. We are meant to be omnivores not herbivores. You can choose too but it’s not for all of us. And please, not all of us believe in Heven and Hell. And anyway, Jesus fed 5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes to the hungry.

3. This is the part I’m most upset about. They had shown video clips of animals being decapitated and slaughtered. I know this is meant to guilt shame us but that to far. Ripping guts and blood is too much and I’m surprised google even let this get through. They stop swearing but let this through??? Come on. I’m not to grossed about it, but I am disgusted at the thought that children and blood/gore sensitive people are viewing this. Lots of people view YouTube and heaps of videos have ads.

It’s just disappointing to see this. If you have an opinion and want it out, do not just put horrid stuff people may have panic attacks from and remember that children are watching it. It can permanently scar their minds and I hope it gets taken down as it is sickening to think kids may see this and feel really bad about something that they don’t need to think about yet. If you’re wondering about what this is called, it called, ‘We are Divine’. Thank you so much for reading, please stay safe.",1587561393.0,7
433,g5j5aq,I got a rude delivery person.," 

My father used the app ""[souq.com](https://souq.com/)"", which is basically amazon in Arab areas, to buy some packages in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  
What my father thought would happen is that he would get the packages sent to him and receive it from a respectful delivery person. Unfortunately, what happened was a shocking experience.

On the day my father was eagerly waiting for his package, he got a message that said, ""Dear Customer, we have called you to deliver your shipment but no response, please call back to arrange your delivery. Thanks Courier – [souq.com](http://souq.com/)"". Weirdly, my father didn't get any calls. My father then talked to the guy delivering the packages to see why did that message pop in his inbox, then that guy told my father that he called my father on his cellphone and that my father didn't answer, obviously that was a lie. My father ended up getting the packages after a couple of arguments on the phone, the delivery guy cursing, and almost hitting my father. My father ended it with the most respectable way and just sent a complaint to souq.

After a week or so, my father had another package getting shipped to his postbox. Sadly ,the same guy, that delivered the last package, delivered this package. And that guy started being unrespectful and rude again. The first sentence he spat was ""so, are you done complaining or what?"" with a mocking but mad mood. My father didn't reply, took the package, and sent another complaint to souq.

souq, of course, did nothing

An industry like [souq.com](https://souq.com/), which is owned by [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com/), must have methods on dealing with this stuff and not just making claims with no evidence. Woefully, that was not the case with souq. Souq failed miserably in dealing with this situation and will lose more users (other than me) if they keep throwing cases of their shoulders.

438,g435r5,Friend is happy someone got coronavirus...,"I have this friend that I’m currently very pissed off at for a comment they made earlier. 

Their significant other’s sister is a nurse and unfortunately just got the coronavirus from working in the hospital. My friend does not like their S/O’s sister for some reasons but imo they’re mostly trivial. To give you an idea of these reasons, they don’t like the sister’s boyfriend because he’s rude and has been to jail for drugs. Which is really just the sister having bad taste but today I received a text from my friend. 

The text informed me that the sister had gotten the virus from working phrased like “[The sister] got corona 😂”. Subsequent texts said another reason my friend didn’t like the sister, and “Karma bitch”. 

When I read these I got so pissed off I didn’t respond. I knew I was going to blow up on my friend and possibly destroy our friendship. Almost regret not doing that now. Because I physically don’t understand why or how someone could be happy that the person they love’s sister has the possibility of dying. Not to mention my state’s health care system is already struggling with lack of nurses and doctors and all. They’re happy that we’re down one more vital healthcare worker.

446,g2jsi1,My fiance's mother hates me and wants me gone.,"She causes so much drama between us to purposefully try and pry us apart. We're engaged and she knows it's just not going to last. I'm pregnant. I'm TWENTY SIX WEEKS pregnant. She hasn't spoken to me since she found out. However she will tell her son that ""he needs to stop having baby momma's"" (he had a child at 19... He's 24 now...) She says things like this infront of me. Calling me basically an incubator for an unwanted, unplanned child. (Our son is unplanned but I'm allergic to birth control we used a condom and it broke so we went right out to buy plan b and it didn't work. At least we tried to be responsible adults and we already live together. We are happy. We cried tears of joy when we found out.) She says all of her insults over the phone on speaker phone to her son about me and his daughters mother... Only because she knows I can hear her. I put my foot down and I told my fiance I was NOT going to take her abuse any longer. I am not some baby momma, I was not some one night stand, she will not treat me like trash and expect me to just comply that's not how this works. Her defence when she finally broke the camel's back to my fiance to the point he stood up to this woman was "" well I haven't even talked to her."" LADY WHAT THE F#CK! She tried to make herself look like the victim like I haven't talked to her so whats the problem? My fiance told her the behavior needed to stop. It has stopped only she hasn't said a word to me in twenty six weeks. She keeps asking if she's going to see this baby when it's born to her son. Not to me to her son. He tells her only if she treats me better or ignores her. Because I will not have her treating me like trash infront of my own child that she wants to talk trash about as well... How does that add up? How does someone do what she does and think that I want her near my child? My fiance knows my word is law on this. She will not be in the hospital when he is born. She will not physically see him unless she wants to be a decent human being to me and my child all the time not just to save face. We all know that once my son is born she's going to want to see him and talk about how horrible I am for not letting her. Her other son my fiance's brother yesterday said I get that she hates you but she's good to my brothers daughter. I said that doesn't matter. She will not show my son that it is okay to treat people this way because it's not. So now at every turn she's trying to undermine me and cause fights. His mother has arranged that while he's starting this new job she's going to get his daughter he never sees during the first two weeks where he's going to be working seven ten and a half hour days and never be able to see his daughter. That's hurting the child more than it hurts my fiance and is relationship. But that's not all... The last time she ""arranged"" to get her granddaughter she decided that she was going to just give her to me because she couldn't be bothered to watch her anymore. She wanted to watch me struggle to take care of her on my own. ( I was throwing up due to being pregnant CONSTANTLY she knew I was having a very hard time) I do not work because I was laid off just before I found out I was pregnant but my fiance makes good money so we're waiting until the baby is born for me to look for work. But anyways we all know that she's going to decide that she doesn't want her granddaughter anymore and put her on me. Which is all fine and good when I don't have to take care of her and her father and how do explain to a three year old that daddy's busy that he's tired that he's got to work and get sleep that he's not abandoned you that he's just busy. You don't. You can't explain that. There's many many more things she's done like threaten us over our relationship using any leverage that she can. It's pathetic and sad. Luckily I know he loves me enough not to leave me. My family on the other hand... They can't believe her. They're over the way that she treats me. It will be interesting to see if she seems to think that even though I don't want her at the hospital when our son is born that she will be allowed. I'd she shows up she will get the shock of her life. My family if not the staff will escort her out. In her place of work no less how embarrassing for her. I assume she will think that she's so important that they will allow her to overrule my wishes. It does not work that way.",1587059348.0,2

•2019
-The cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris in France is seriously damaged by a large fire.

•2014
-In the worst massacre of the South Sudanese Civil War, at least 200 civilians were gunned down after seeking refuge in houses of worship as well as hospitals.

•2013
-Two bombs explode near the finish line at the Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, killing three people and injuring 264 others.

•1970
-During the Cambodian Civil War, massacre of the Vietnamese minority results in 800 bodies flowing down the Mekong river into South Vietnam.

•1969
-The EC-121 shootdown incident: North Korea shoots down a United States Navy aircraft over the Sea of Japan, killing all 31 on board.

•1865
-President Abraham Lincoln dies after being shot the previous evening by actor John Wilkes Booth. Vice President Andrew Johnson becomes President upon Lincoln's death.




Again, these are just some of the events that have happened the same day in their respected years. Remember: all of our doctors, nurses, and essential employees are our heroes in this novel disease. They are putting their lives at risk and are saving our asses each and every single day. We can't pay them enough for what they have been through. So to all of those aforementioned people, THANK YOU.

And for those of you who aren't essential, who do their work at home and/or teach the kids and making sure that they are on task, or to those teachers/school staff adapting to this new way of life, a big THANK YOU to you too! We all know it's always hard when dealing with kids, but remember it's for their best outcome.

And for those of you who are not taking this seriously, honestly should you even be on planet Earth? I know change is hard, believe me. I'm a military child so I usually experience that every 3-5 years. But that doesn't negate the fact that this virus replicates and spreads FAST and it can kill the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.  

DON'T FUCK THIS UP PEOPLE. Healthcare systems around the world are so stretched, that it's so hard to find Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and ventilators. STAY HOME, and if needed; socially distance, respect ALL rules and guidelines, and treat others with care (without touching, obviously).

Their marriage had been a disaster for as long as I could remember, with their constant arguments evolving to physical violence on a handful of occasions (mostly instigated by my mother). Knowing this, I was pretty understanding when dad left mom after one such conflict left him with a black eye, and my mom threatened to call the cops on him for something I witnessed him not do. I even forgave him on the spot when he finally confessed to a long-term affair he had been having (I just assumed he had one for a while), because I have always known that both of my parent were miserable in there marriage (I also have reason to believe my mom had an affair first). Still, I didn’t really want to meet his mistress (which I don’t’ think is unreasonable), but he tricked me into an awkward dinner with her a mere week later, and continued to force me to be around her for the next month (when I made it very clear I really didn’t want anything to do with her). Turns out, he was making a half-assed attempt to quickly bond the two of us (and my sister (14)) so that he could move her in ASAP. Me and my sister begged him not to, just because it was super soon after pretty messy divorce (it took a particularly hard toll on my younger sister) but he accused us of not wanting him to be happy, and more or less ignored us. Things have not gotten better with this women once we began sharing my dad’s pretty tight townhouse, especially since we’ve been locked up because of Coronavirus, while my dad still occasionally leaves us with her to go to work. Now I can’t stand being at his place, and really resent him for this. I don’t think I’ve said five word to this women, and she’s obviously very uncomfortable around me and my sister, so I have no idea why she agreed to move in (it’s also with noting that she’s 15 years younger than my dad).

I haven't posted it yet because I'm not sure I'm striking the right tone. I don't want to sound whiny or libelous, but I have to convey how pissed I am while remaining somewhat civil. I've gone over it to shorten it as much as possible.  


I just can't get over the Coronavirus stuff. Three different guys in my home without so much as a mask, when the pandemic was in full swing. They didn't even use the hand sanitizer I put out while they were touching the machine, which they didn't bother to wipe down.  


An elliptical is the best exercise for my bad knee and my anxiety, and there are few other choices.  


I realize some of this may be unclear out of context. 

>I received a very disappointing e-mail from Precor. The tone was condescending, unlike the note below. Maybe I'm overreacting. Or maybe I'm tired of the way this company treats a customer after they've taken their money. I responded with a very brief and polite request for clarification on 3/30. No reply.   
>  
>The gist of the e-mail was that one store manager was the only person that could do what should have been done FIVE MONTHS ago. He hasn't.  
>  
>I'd like to clear a few things up.  
>  
>1) I am AWARE of the distinction between Corporate Precor and the franchise. I was confused because Corporate answered my inquiries, spoke with me on the phone for an hour, and sent a tech. It wasn't until THREE MONTHS later that I was told they would no longer help.  
>  
>2) I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE STORE. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE MANAGER REPEATEDLY. My situation has not improved.   
>  
>3) Keep in mind that the store's floor model was BROKEN IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. That makes three. Coincidence?  
>  
>4) I \*never\* expected that ""daily updates"" to Trustpilot (more like three or four over several weeks) were sent to the store. That's absurd. I will post as many updates as I please.      
>  
>5) I don't know what Precor means by ""incorrect contact info."" I gave them three different means.  
>  
>6) I will again state how furious I was when three people came to my home with no regard for the pandemic. There is a vulnerable adult in the house. I called the store on 4/3. They didn't seem concerned, but said the tech would take precautions and they would call back. They didn't. Putting me through five months of anxiety and frustration while depriving me of my primary means of exercise was bad enough.

The amount of people who blatantly ignore the rules and prance up and down the aisle at their free will is infuriating. One guy bombed up and down the middle of the aisle this morning 3 times whilst others patiently waited 2m apart from each other allowing people to leave the aisle safely etc. This same guy was also wearing a face mask so you can tell he’s perfectly happy to possibly pass it on to other people but no way was he taking any chances of catching it himself.

A few days ago, I was banned from a sub based around a semi-popular game. I replied to the message, inquiring as to why I was banned, because as far as I know, I didn’t break any rules. While I have a sneaking suspicion that I know which comment led to it, I want to explain why this is bullshit and a perfect example of mods abusing their powers.

The post was a short complaint about a recent feature added to the game, that had been advertised and hyped up for a while, and why they thought it was a letdown. This individual explained that they had donated real, legal money to the developer’s patreon in an effort to help with the game’s production. They explained that they felt that their investment wasn’t worth it, because so much time had passed with relatively low progress in the game’s production. 

Anyhoo, I left a comment stating that I liked the way the new feature was implimented, and that I believed it was worth it. I had also stated that I understood their viewpoint and sympathized with them. 



A day later, I’m perma-banned and the post was deleted. So now I can’t even use my replies to prove I didn’t do anything.

Last November, I made the financial stretch to buy a Precor. I couldn't believe it when the resistance malfunctioned out of the box. 

After a few months (!), Precor agreed it was a lemon and replaced it with one that had the same flaw. The installer didn't bother to level the machine and it rattled loudly (had to fix it myself). Precor sent a tech who pedaled on it for a few minutes and said it was fine. At my next workout, the resistance collapsed when I was at full speed.

No one who came to my home took any Coronavirus precautions (I had hand sanitizer out). 

Precor is giving me the runaround, saying it's the individual store's fault. The store isn't much better and has a hard time returning calls. I reminded Precor that I'll soon be in the fifth month of this, but they basically shrugged and sent a condescending email chastising me for daring to update my Trustpilot review ""daily."" I had done so twice. 

It also told me that the store manager is the only one who can help, and that the corporation would do nothing. From the store, all I get are sorrys and false promises (being ignored by the tech right now). And yet the writer gave me his address so I could e-mail him ""directly."" Which is it? I wrote a very brief and very polite response. It was ignored.

Precor acts like I'm making this up. They should have seen the store's floor model which was broken in the same way.

What do I do? Hope they 'll find a decent tech? Fight for a refund? File a BBB complaint? It would be difficult to choose a different machine since there's no way to try one out. I tried several at Sears before they died, and they all felt cheap.

He got better but Im still scared. My birthday was this month and I cant visit him and he is on the opposite side of the country.
My aunt who is so incredibly sweet is sick and I was told she might not make it last week. I cried as my mom told me. I cant visit her.
My sister and childhood best friend got sick with what might be the virus. She is probably fine but scares me. I havent seen her for almost a year.
My lease ended and I had purchased a small peice of desert land to build on. I was working on it last weekend and sprained my ankle.
Today I found someone broke into my cargo trailer and stole my tools and a very precious guitar given by my best friend from home. We worked on ranches together and we played guitar and wrote music together. Its gone.
Work is hell bc of the virus and I cant keep track of everything. Everybody is living this rn I imagine.
I have no close friends here and no significant other. I really need someone close right now but I am alone. I honestly dont know how to meet someone after college.

512,fsrwuu,Plea for help / complaint for YMCA daycare situation,"I have family working at a YMCA. My mother-in-law (MIL) and sister-in-law (SIL). They’re official guidelines are to have 6 kids per teacher allowed for my MIL’s class, or 9 in my SIL’s case, but with this virus they are expecting to have over 30 for my MIL’s class and ~45 for my SIL’s class. The SIL’s child is also in that daycare. 

They have not been provided with masks, two teachers are not going to be there for quite some time (one because of surgery and one *because their daughter has a bad cold*), and they are way understaffed. The YMCA has come out with a nation-level notice promising at least one teacher per a max of 10 kids. My family’s boss is always going over-limit on the teacher-kid ratio.

The YMCA is proudly boasting that they are going to be heroes for doing this so that the medical staff can have a place for their kids for free, which is great, but they need to be more responsible:

Despite the shortage, they need to at least seek to provide masks somehow to the staff. The CDC is debating about going against their no-masks recommendation and it’s obvious that they would help. The YMCA needs to be encouraging everyone to be keeping their kids with family or friends instead as much as they can.

If one of these kids gets it, kids are very likely to be or seem asymptomatic. Additionally, they put everything in their mouths, including their hands. If one kid gets it, many other kids will get it. **Medical workers’ kids.** This can let it spread easily into our hospital workers’ staff. If the doctors get sick, who will take care of our sick and save lives?

Something needs to be done. Who can be contacted to complain to while protecting my family from getting fired? It is NOT ok that they are this understaffed. The teacher-kid ratio is NOT ok.

This is all ignoring that my MIL is very overweight and older and this sickness could kill her. She will be changing potentially sick kids’ diapers and the virus is known to be in frack matter. 

What can be done? My MIL thinks her boss or the boss’ boss won’t care. How do I complain in a way that protects their privacy? Who do I complain to? How do I the YMCA to try to encourage that kids should be cared for by family/friends when possible right now? What do I do?",1585712384.0,3

She is a very sweet and loving girl and she has a hard time understanding alot of things that any other nine year old girl would understand but she tries her best.

Anyways, my husband and I are firefighters and my sister doesn't understand why I moved away but gets super excited when we come to visit and runs up to give me a hug the second she sees me. Ready for it or not lol. Well, we got a call today while we were visiting for the first time in a month or two and do we went and after that we were going to go back home (we live an hour and a half away, we are only still on that department because we try to visit as much as we can and they love it's there). Well, I was really looking forward to being able to give all of my siblings a hug before I left but everybody came in contact with a possible COVID-19 carrier so now I can't give my siblings a hug before I leave and don't see them for a few months. After 2 hours of fighting the fire and cleaning up I head back to their house because I left some things. My youngest sister tried to run up to my and give me a big tight hug but my mom stopped her and told her she couldn't and why and so she said 
""Okay air hugs"" and opened her arms as wide as she could with a really big smile on her face and hugged herself and said ""OP, you have to do this so I can hug you"".

Booking.com HANG UP 

This was an absolutely unpleasant experience. I am shocked and appalled, well not that shocked. We are in QLD Australia so we cannot make our reservation in Melbourne due to the world wide pandemic (maybe you've heard of it). My partner and I were recently stood down (laid off) as a result of Covid19 and need a refund. There was no sympathy for our situation. Our customer service representative, kept repeating the company line that that the reservation was non-refundable and this is company policy as she was WELL-TRAINED by her non flexible, faceless company. They are completely un-accountable and selfish as they use this global catastrophe to line their pockets. 

Everyday you hear of companies going above and beyond for their customers and easing the suffering of people facing unprecedented economic hardship, this is NOT one of them. We would ask for a refund or to talk to a manager who can assist us, to which she replied ""I am the manager"". (not fun when you're on the receiving end) In the end she hung up on us. She was incredibly well trained but completely unwilling to offer a compromise or solution. Like talking to a brick wall.

A company like 'booking.com' should be more flexible with their policies in the event of a global emergency. This company is making money off of a global pandemic and should be ashamed. Policies should be flexible in light of this unprecedented situation. While governments are moving mountains to protect people, companies like this are taking advantage and profiting. For the sake of a $200 refund, booking.com has lost a customer for life, but I doubt they'll care. Corona virus will end eventually but this unpleasant experience and terrible customer service will remain.

They have done so much training, learned their lines, taken directions, tried out costumes and props. All for nothing.
The kids still get to come to the classes, but no audience or parents.

They had all the time in the world to send it out but I guess doing their fucking jobs is too much for their 0.5 cubic planck length brains to handle. I've called them several times now and every time the customer service cunt on the other end of the line more or less told me to go fuck myself with a stinging nettle in the most roundabout way possible. Fuckheads.

The postie rocked up about two hours ago and I got all excited because I thought maybe one of my knives has arrived by now. Nope, just a bunch of letters for my Gran and a legal advice manual for some COMPLETELY UNRELATED random woman who lives like twenty blocks away on a street with a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT name and COMPLETELY DIFFERENT street number. In my previous gripe about AusPost I got very tilted because the posties apparently just can't fucking read. Now it's confirmed. These cunts are fucking retarded.

Also, I was just looking on shipping costs for parcels of various sizes so I can figure out how much I should price a sword of a certain size and guess what? Their maximum fucking packaging length that they'll allow you to send is 105cm and the length of the sword I've got sat here in front of me is 110cm. With packaging that might bring it up to 120cm.

553,fkxtlw,“Simple” Free App Store games suck,"I hate the majority of the “simple” free App Store games. All you see are those stupid crappy “Ball Roll 3D” games and they absolutely suck. They’re all a carbon copy of each other and nothing is original or decent anymore besides a few select games. The current top game is “Spiral Roll” and it doesn’t take a big brain to figure out what that game is all about. The second top game is “Ultimate Disc” which, surprise surprise, is about throwing a disc. It’s so unentertaining, and all the games are absolute pieces of trash coughed up in someone’s unkempt basement. I’ve literally never seen a decent free game on the top of the free games chart since 2-3 years ago. And that’s horribly disappointing. To the person that started this chain, I have nothing against you, sometimes simple games are fun as well. But to the people that copied that company, and I hope you’re reading this: you suck. Dearly. I’ve literally never been able to enjoy any games on the store for so long now because of the people like you. And it also annoys me that apple allows garbage like this as well. You’d think that with the advancement of today’s software and game engines games would only get better, but NO! It’s like they’ve actually devolved over the years to all become clones of each other. Whenever you look up the world “roll”, it’s literally all a bunch of crappy simple move the ball games! There’s no sophisticated games anymore, no decent graphical games anymore, not even any good smooth running games without ads after every round! It’s terrible! Apple has literally never done a thing to try to combat this besides Apple Arcade, and don’t even get me started on Android. On Android, you literally can’t even look up one game without seeing some copy that looks like it was made in the 1980’s. May as well be worse than games from the 1980’s. Android has been getting better over the years in terms of operating system, but it’s games haven’t gotten any better in terms of copy filtering, and quality. If I had to give my honest opinion, Apple is a lot better than Android, but that’s just me. Maybe I’m right, maybe I’m wrong, but that’s just my opinion.

2. Unfair! Some employees have the privileges to work at home because they can. Most of them, are people who are doing NOTHING like low level contribution who just come in the office just to drink coffee and gossip stuff. Like, 10% working, 90% sitting there doing social media, drinking coffee, gossip, whatever sh\*t stuff they do. Plus, complain when they are given SMALL F\*CKING SIMPLE TASK.
3. **Supervisor is f\*cking BASTARD**! He's a bossy sh\*t who takes credit from us by doing NOTHING! Got all the praise but not a single letter or idea contributed on our project but has all privileged to anything and boss around like he knows all. Looks down on me also because I am a girl. Bias with my boy colleagues because he is GAY!
4. Manager is too nice to tell our supervisor that **he is sh\*t.** Even though most of us already talked to our manager with our supervisor toxicity, he did not do anything.
5. Senior manager is bias. He only thinks his angels first who doesn't do anything! Bunch of girls that sits on the office every day just to gossip and try to get pretty but they aren't! Covers the sloppiness of our supervisor.
6. NO GROWTH. We are web developers who use fucking old methods! Our supervisor doesn't even know how to use boostrap or f\*cking CSS! I am a 15 fucking years younger than him but I have more knowledge than he does.

The only good thing here is that we can control our time and salary isn't so bad. So us, who contribute well on the company has to sit here and try risks ourselves and our family by going out and being infected. Us that were not given the opportunity to do home based has to do shifting so that we are not exposed to each other. Already voiced out my concerns on our Manager, ***has no power to do anything***.

So, anyone who chooses to make it their job to promote these abominable laws is a horrible human.  I don't mean to compare them to some evil world leader.  That would require these cop wannabes to have political skills.  Or, really any skills other than sucking on tax money, taking more money from hard working people who do real jobs.

I could understand taking a parking enforcement job if your only other choice was prostituting your body to homeless drunks,  but otherwise,  I'd say flipping burgers or digging ditches would be infinitely more socially acceptable and allow you to live a life where not everyone you meet during your work day wants to see you buried up to your neck in fresh, wet manure.

And who would want to be dating or married to one of these parking scum?  If they're willing to take money from strangers all day, who's to say that they're not cheating on you with stray animals?

604,fdgvju,I can’t colour anything even if it saved my life,"So I draw a lot, and I’ve basically spent my teens (and tweens) so far drawing very often as a hobby. After a few years (I started getting interested around the age of 11 or 12 so like 4 years) there’s a lot of things I’ve learned and mastered. I’ve developed my own somewhat unique style I’m quite fond of, because it mixes between cartoony and realistic, I’ve pretty much mastered hands, I can draw different and somewhat advanced hairstyles and I’m good to go with general anatomy as long as it’s above the hips/genitalia area. Not sure why, but I just can’t do legs very well, probably because I haven’t tried in a while.

But anyways, after all these years there’s one bloody simple thing I cannot do and that I’ve barely improved on since I started. In fact I think I’ve gotten worse. And what is that thing? Colouring. I cannot colour anything at all without it looking like if an 80’s music video shit on a canvas. Well maybe that’s an exaggeration, the problem is more that the colours are too dull and somehow extremely unnatural. But still, 80s music video feces on a canvas would look about the same. Worst part is I can’t tell until I’m finished. 

I do well on skin and skin shading (mostly) , but HOLY fuck the clothes look like the stuff you find under carpets, and if I’m trying to make special effects lord save me

About a week ago I attempted to draw an old character I used to love to make comics with to see how far I have come with everything. My interests and humor when it came to comics at the time was my idea of hell, the supernatural, magic and gore etc (you gotta have me excused, I was like 11 or 12) so I drew a slightly gory picture depicting this character. He was cartoonishly decapitated (by cartoonish I mean it was anatomically incorrect and by it I mean the neck without the head) and his head was floating in the air, I also gave some floating hands. Basically I had the idea of drawing this character using magic powers to walk around with chopped off limbs, because that would be cool to my 12 year old self. 

Lineart turned out pretty cool, and my idea of representing exactly what my 12 year old self would like was to add magical looking effects at the wrists of the floating hands as well as near the head. It failed, and it just looked like a 5 year old splashed paint on it. It looks like a collaboration the world absolutely didn’t need, half the stuff is coloured fine and then there’s just every colour that’s not related to hair or skin is just vomit worthy. Ouch

But Gotta end it quick (well, it wasn’t quick) though, I’m actually going to go attempt to learn how to do the stuff right now via a shit ton of tutorials, so that’s why I’m complaining  about my ability (or lack of, rather) to colour stuff.

I talked to him in person about my low score and his contradicting comments on my essay done followed by his guidance, but he just denied responsibilites and even threatened me not to appeal (I secretly recorded the whole conversation). He also failed both of my friend's modules and now he has to transfer to another programme because he can't stand it anymore.

We currently still have a module being taught by him, and as usual he's answering questions vaguely, changing rooms last minute, changing formats of assessments and ignoring my emails (because he think I was challenging his abilities), but other students are quite afraid of him revenging through scores, so they didn't say anything.

I know if only me appealing my score and filing a formal complaint to the school (takes 3 months), it is too late and not likely to work. I know most students are not happy with his teaching, markings and comments, but I really don't know what to do.

The class representative told me to talk to the course leader, but I'm afraid my anonymity is disclosed and the course leader will think I'm annoying... But, I can't risk this module to be ruined by him anymore...

635,f5geoq,People who complain about legal hunting are ignorant.,"Hunting feral and introduced species of animals helps control negative population growth which endangers the ecosystem, farming and sometimes human lives. Tag hunting like they have in the US has proceeds go to assist in maintaining national parks and only a limited amount of tags go out for specific animals of certain sizes, sexes and species so as not only protect other species but also control the possibility of overpopulation. Many hunters insist on using every part of that animal so as not to wastefully kill it and also to show some respect to its life by using every part. I'm not for senseless illegal trophy hunting or hunting endangered species for any reason but it does serve a purpose and hunters aim for a quick and painless kill where possible. This is why many rifle hunters look down on bow hunting because it causes more pain and suffering than is necessary. Hunting feral dogs, cats, pigs and others helps protect the rest of the animal population from being killed by introduced species or having their habitats destroyed.

Reading a news report about some asshat tweeting some shitpost about a hunter taking down a pig with a shotgun he called a ""sniper rifle"" and using dogs (they help herd an animal to go the right way and help protect the shooter as wild boars are very savage) has me rather riled up.

643,f42lnb,I know that I'm fat and I know why. Don't be telling me anything.,"Okay. I just saw a Tik Tok with some dude, screeching out as to why fat people are fat, complaining about how we sit in drive thru's like Wendy's ""24/7"" then ""sweat it off at the gym"" like he's bestowing wisdom on us. _AS HE'S PULLING OUT OF A WENDY'S DRIVE THRU._

I bet you anything that he was sitting in the drive thru, getting the works and saw a fat person in front of him, they might've taken a minute too long, I don't know, but he just _had_ to turn around and rant about it, like it's the difference between life and death. 

Listen dude, none of this is news to me. I know what I do, I know what I put in my mouth, I know I don't exercise as much as I need to, but don't need you to tell me that. Am I proud of it? Absolutely not, but I do it, just like any other junk food craving person does, I just do it too much and I'm working on correcting it. 

 Is it your business? No. I don't hang over your munching face and judge every calorie that goes in your body, so don't be judging me, _ESPECIALLY_ if you're gonna be eating the same things I do. You doesn't have to be fat to be unhealthy and he may be healthier than I am, but he still doesn't have a right to be judgemental.

644,f39jzh,Tom's Guide / Tom's Hardware mods removing and erasing posts in secret to protect secret Facebook account locking,"TIRED of the wearying political MODS removing anything they can if they think it furthers their political agenda.  Today it is FB lockouts.  
I have had 3 out of 3 posts and replies removed after posting about FB lockouts.  
The original post started 2017 and was never resolved.  
FB is politcally locking accounts.   FB in their screens specifically quote political comments and require you to click on them... it is obviously political.

If you view their forum communiy discussion, you find there are LOADS of posts about this problem - and these are just the ones they haven't deleted.

MY chat reply to a mod who (finally) replied and acted like he was a wounded party - proudly announced that 1st ammendment does not apply (it's a fucking technical discussion... what are you sniffing you weirdo)

&#x200B;

You have cut out 3 out of 3 posts which were on topic and valid.  
If you have nohing to hide then stop hiding information.  
If  ""Necro""-ing was an issue then - then perhaps you ought to remove ""Post  Reply"" buttons, or lock old threads - instead of leaving valid controls  that anyone can push that contavene some kind of perceived social  contract moderator's head - written somewhere whimsical - which sounds  like you just arbitrarily delete anything you feel like using a suite of  vague subjective rules than you selectively apply.  


You  are not even leaving the in a de-activated state, you are removing them  as if they did not exist.  EVERYONE knows what that is called.

The post was definitely NOT ""clearly over"", because nobody had come up wih a solution.   


You are deleting knowledge.  
There is nothing moderate about this type of 'moderation'.  
The point of threads is to build knowledge on a topic.  Knowledge that is inconvenient is being deleted.  


I  have no idea what you ae taking about a profanity with a \* letter -  obviously, because the information has been erased.  Which is exactly  the problem with this kind of Im-a-rockstar modding.  


Why  on EARTH would a technical discussion board - glibly quote that 1st  ammendment does not apply as if it is some kind of achievement!?!? You  are contavneing your own GRAPES policy quoting the constitution -   say  this is non political.  If I need the FIRST AMMENDMENT to talk about a  Facebook lockout screen, what has the world come to?  
 

People  are increasingly frustrated by politically inspired bullying by  politcal activists calling themselves moderators. If you can't cope with  that - or the the idea that people aren't impresed by weird silent  removals of information, maybe this isn't for you. You are suffocating  normal discussion and creating an environment everyone hates.  


\[QUOTE=""bignastyid, convMessage: 4675693, member: 516849""\]

The old thread and was never answered until you necro'd the thread.

""Necro  post. If a thread is clearly old (created more than 3 months ago) and  the discussion is over, please don't post to it. However, feel free to  link to the old thread in your new post, just to add additional context.  The majority of necro posts are deleted, and those threads are then  closed.""

In some cases If the necro'd thread had no  good responses then the thread will just be deleted. Your post was also  in violation of the forums grapes and profanity rules(using a \* for one  letter doesn't make it ok}.

The forum is privately owned and has rules, the 1st amendment does not apply.

We also delete all political talk as it's part of the G.R.A.P.E.S policy

""  G.R.A.P.E.S. (that's an acronym) are disallowed topics. This list  includes guns, religion, abortion, politics, economics, sexuality, and  anything related to them. The moderation team reserves the right to  remove any such posts and take action as warranted. For more detail on  this policy, please refer to this.""

\[URL unfurl=""true""\]https📷/forums.tomshardware.com/threads/new-policy-no-grapes.1928200/\[/URL\]

The  thread you created was flagged by the spam filter likely due to the  multiple edits with a new account, and since it violates the grapes  policy it has been deleted.

Also  coming in and calling Mods communists because you can't follow the  rules(that you agreed to) isn't going to get you very far.  If you don't  want to follow the rules there's and unsub link in your profile.

645,f35fre,I hate my work place,I told my friend/coworker I wanted to call off but then she started complaining about me calling off and kept telling me to go in with her. I repeatedly stated I didn’t want to go as I have school in the morning (I work overnight) and I have a test in one of my classes. She brings up the fact I need money and duh everyone does but I hate putting my mental health down just for money. I don’t even “need” the money which I tell her only for her to complain about my work ethic and what not. I feel like she only wants me to go in bc she has to go in and she is the kind of person. Who can’t do anything alone or be independent. But at the same time does it really matter if I don’t wanna go in??? She says she doesn’t wanna argue with me about it but then continually pushes the matter to where it leads into an argument. Like SHES being a good friend I guess but I feel there’s more to it but maybe I’m being immature and a shitty friend/coworker.,1581573552.0,2

658,f09zea,My classmates are very naïve,"As the title suggests, my classmates are very naïve and it bothers me very much to the point that I'm anxious. The thought popped up today and I can't stop thinking now. 

For your context, I have a very strict English teacher and he doesn't like people making unnecessary noises. Like not even whispering too loudly(I'm fine with that). Let's call him Lee.

Lee is teaching about tenses today and he is writing notes on the whiteboard. My classmates over on the other side are chit-chatting quietly but very frequently. Then they dropped a metallic file/clip on the floor and it made a loud and sharp noise. Lee didn't have any reaction yet. I feel like they're not satisfied with his reaction and they kept chit-chatting and he warned us the first time before things get worse.

Normally, they would just get the signal and just stop talking but they are getting more and more aggravated for the past few days and now they started dropping things to make noise and even showing the middle finger when Lee turns to the whiteboard. It triggers my anger when they do that because they don't seem to think the consequences of playing under a lion's mane even if it's a sleeping lion. It seems so stupid to me.

Maybe because I'm a very rational person, so I try to think at their point of view. It didn't really help and it just makes me more angry.

Qwant worked great on my phone for nearly a year. Recently, Qwant decided to add a ""Hot Trends,"" which is photo thumbnails, (4-5 of them, I think), for links to trending search topics. Or, as I like to call it, ""a digital anal fissure,"" since shit is slowly coming out on my phone every time, and it's irritating me on top of irritation each time it happens. 

I didn't ask for hot trends. I don't fucking want hot trends. I have my own, specific search criteria in mind when I open a search app, such as searching actors names when I watch NCIS with my Boomer uncle. I don't need a 15th avenue to trending news stories. News is everywhere, every day. On Reddit, my Roku, and my phone's launcher app. I used to have other news apps, but they were too much. Nobody needs *that* much fucking awareness! 

As mentioned in the title, when I load the Qwant app, it brings up grey boxes, waiting too many goddamn minutes to load the thumbnails. While the thumbnails load, it won't let me bring up the keyboard and begin my search. Each thumbnail loads slowly, one at a time, at the pace of a DMV worker. Sometimes, the app threatens to close. Sometimes it does close. The entire time it's happening, I know what I want to search, and I know it isn't for some mother fricking, cock slurping, pumpkin humping, cow diarrhea eating HaWtt TrINz! 

I've tried to search settings to find a way to disable the Hot Turds, but I find no way to do this. 

Qwant, if you're listening, to be clear, I hate your Hot Trends feature with every fiber of my being, and I would like very much for you to go back to being the Qwant you were, the app I fell in love with, before you stopped loving life. You need help, Qwant. This isn't like you. You're being negative, and pushing people away, all while vying for attention. Just the internal conflict alone must be a strain for you.

Like no one should need to learn how to cook like Gordon Ramsay (I only want to get about a tenth of the way myself) but if you live off Macca's and get all huffy like a fucking toddler when OTHER PEOPLE offer to cook shit for you just because you're too much of a weak entitled little BITCHCYCLE who's too attached to fast food to just TRY eating kidneys then you're just a fucking a waste of space. I know what I'm doing. I've eaten kidneys. I like them. That's why I want to try doing it myself and I'm willing to spend AN EIGHTH OF A FUCKING DAY WHEN I COULD BE DOING LOTS OF OTHER SHIT just to cook myself and other people (your disrespectful arse included) a meal. If you want to opt out due to your shithouse character quality then that's on you but don't you fucking DARE expect me to cook SHIT for you ever again and don't you fucking DARE expect a Big Mac to replace it, you fucking wastrel. Cook something yourself. Cook an actual fucking dish; not a Big Mac and not fucking beans on toast. In this case, she can't. And she probably never will because that's the sort of wastrel she is.

He doesn’t even have his drivers license. He says he will get a job after school (and when he gets a car) because he wants to “experience freedom.” I can kinda see where he’s coming from, I mean, you just want a break after 12 years of school. However, it doesn’t excuse him from not having his drivers license. My family likes to use door dash. But, our door dash sucks and has just a little bit of things but not a lot. Whenever we really want something, it would be a lot easier if my brother COULD DRIVE. It gets really annoying when we COULD get out of situations if my brother could drive. We have been pressuring and pressuring him to really focus on his driving. We keep on saying,”You’re going to be screwed if you don’t get it this year.” What also sucks is that he doesn’t even like driving, it makes sense I mean some people just don’t like driving. Thing is, my mom loves driving and his dad (we’re half-siblings) LOVES driving. It’s insane-bonkers even. That’s really it, but he really needs to get his license now. My mom says that he will.

681,evjt4o,Everything is way too woke,"I'm watching Star Trek Discovery.  I love Star Trek.  I like parts of this show, but it's showing me something all too completely true about the last couple years:

We have become too ""woke.""  And, ""woke"" is horrible.  Forcing gender and race theories, believed by only a tiny percentage of people (most of them university professors who couldn't hold a real job if their life depended on it) down our throats.

Calling a beautiful woman ""Michael"" for no apparent reason, making her more of a man instead of completely a woman, is just a bad idea.  She plays the emotionless card (like some gender-studies undergrad's concept of a ""toxic man"" exactly like a woman trying to play a man.  Then she gets all emotional, but it's violent, and doesn't look right on her.

And don't get me started on her beating up a male Klingon with a strength move!  Impossible in any universe.

Then, the Klingons - making the light skinned ones the underdogs.  All this shows is that Klingons are more racist than American humans!

The Avengers.  Captain Marvel, without emotion, saying that it was more important to save a thousand random worlds than the one she was born on.  And everyone agreeing, thoughtfully.  The thinly veiled attack on nationalism is offensive.

And, don't get me started on Doctor Who.  What a quick and seemingly permanent slide into woke drivel at the sake of ruined story lines and pointless characters.

692,et2hdr,Letter to Tiger Air CEO Merren McArthur,"Hi Merren 

Sorry to distrube but I think what we expeirenced is important for you to know as a CEO of Tiger Air. It is about the moral and ethical standards of your staff and potentailly a reflection of the culture and value of the company. I believe we have been REPEATED LIED to by your staff. Two of your staff at the Melbourne airport are the subject of this matter. The supervisor gave us her first name as Amber but refused to give us her last name. Another staff (will refer to as staff Unknown below) refused to give us her name completely. 

My family's original booking on 22nd Jan 2020 was TT256 (Melbourne - Sydney), scheduled departure time was at 4:35pm and arrival at 6:00pm. We arrived at the airport at 3pm and were informed that the plane was delayed to depart at 6:20pm. My wife has some medical conditions (she has a disability card). She has daily medical routines at every evening therefore I enquired at the service desk and changed to TT238, scheduled to depart at 5:10pm. Unfortunately TT238 was cancelled subsequently. We therefore queued, as instructed, to rebook TT256 (our original flight). Without going through too much detail, here's the rundown of issues:

1. We were travelling with two girls, one at 11 years old and the other at 14 years old. When asked if there’s any family with children, we raised our hands but were told by Supervisor Amber that they were too old to be considered as young children. This is important because the fact that we have an 11 years old became an excuse of her later.
2. When we were doing the rebooking, Supervisor Amber asked us to stand aside as she would adjust seating later so we could be together. So we did and she continued going through all the passengers  (about 30-50 I think) behind us. We do not know how it would be easier to arrange our seats at the end with all the seats being issued to others but we did not question it and waited patiently.
3. When Supervisor Amber was ready to rebook our tickets she realised that she only left 3 seats for us, a family of 4. She did not apologise at all simply said our only chance is if there's a no-show passenger. I suggested that we know who the last ticket went to and that passenger (single traveller) was right there. Maybe she could explain the situation that the last ticket should not have been given to him? It would not be nice to that passenger but on the other hand we are more entitled to that ticket on the first come first serve basis. Amber rejected this suggestion but no reason was given. So again, we were asked to stand aside and wait for no-shows. Then Supervisor Amber disappeared.
4. We waited as the entire queue finished boarding. The computer showed there were 5 passengers not boarded. I asked Staff Unknown whether we could board now with no-shows. She and her colleague started calling for those late passengers. Two more went through. Then one came and said his group (assume 3 people) would not board this flight. SURELY WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BOARD THE PLANE NOW???
5. NO!!! There was absolutely NOT any intention whatsoever to let us board that plane. Waiting for no-show was simply a LIE! Staff Unknown kept saying she would not deal with this. Supervisor Amber  came in, but not for us. She did not listen to us, did not check the no-show passengers. She simply came in to close the gate and left. Staff Unknown refused our request to talk to the supervisor, not providing any answers to our questions, and threatened us if we didn’t immediately walk away and stop asking questions.
6. Supervisor Amber showed up again later, and offered a list of new lies in my view:

* **“Children under 12 must be sitting next to an adult.”** If this is ture, then

a), why were we told at the beginning that our children were too old to be treated as children?

b), the no show passengers are a group of 3, chances are their seats are together? (Supervisor Amber did not check no-shows at all)

c), why was this never a problem until she made the mistake of only leaving 3 seats for us?

* **“We pulled off one passenger only. You need 3 no-shows.”** Blatant lie! Why there's a need of 3 no-shows for one extra seat? She didn’t know I was right there looking at the computer and know three passengers actually didn’t board the plane. I believe there were 6 empty seats on that plane in the end! 3 passengers not boarding plus the 3 she kept aside for us.
* **“I have done you a big favour and removed paying customers to get you on the next plane”** (TT264). There were many empty seats on TT264. I was sitting next to two empty seats as an example. Why would she need to remove paying customers off the airplane to make places for us?
* **“Your plane (TT264) may leave earlier than this one”** As I suspiciously looked over to the gate for TT264, there’s absolutely no sign of any airplane ready to go. Supervisor Amber disappeared while I was looking away. We waited another 1.5 hours. We arrived home past 11pm and my wife had to skip her medical rountine completely.
* When I asked for the last name of the Supervisor Amber. She refused and said I didn’t need to know. When I asked for Staff Unknown’s name, to both Staff Unknown herself and Supervisor Amber, both said I had no rights to know her name.

I have a few questions wanting to be answered.

* Why do your staff not letting customers know their names when customers made clear a complaint will be made against them? Does your organisation have any intention to address issues raised? If yes, how do you achieve that allowing your staff not giving their names to identify themselves?
* Why do your staff intentionally lie to customers?
* Why do your staff never apologise even when they made a mistake in the first place?
* Why do your staff think it is ok to ORDER customers to go away when they made a mistake and the customers are only asking legitimate questions?

I'd like answers to the questions above and I am not interested in compensation or credits. This is our first trip with Tiger air and I will be frankly that my entire family will never be your customers again, not because of delays or cancellations, but because of the dishonesty and the complete lack of integrity and sense of responsibility. If these staff represents your company then your company has serious culture and value issues. Judging by some reports about Tiger Air I am afraid that might be true. I only wish we knew before.

I went to Longhorn Steakhouse with friends.  The waitress brought the food to our table, and sat the tray on a folding table next to me.  She picked up my friend’s plate of food, swung around and smacked me directly in the forehead.  She said nothing to me, reached over me, and sat the food in front of my friend.  The plate had recently come out from under a broiler and now had my hair singed to it.  I didn’t know what hit me.  I was later told by my neurologist that because I was stationary and the plate was moving in a swinging motion, I was hit with a force equivalent to hitting a windshield at a speed of 60 mph.  My friend screamed for a manager.  The manager came and gave me a bag of ice, the check quickly came, and we were told it would be best if we left.  
I was in a daze.  We went back to our hotel.  My friends quickly realize that an ambulance needed to be called.  I was talking gibberish and was showing signs of a concussion.
Longhorn sent me a letter stating that they would pay for all of my medical bills.  They then denied paying any of them.  I had to get a lawyer and because I live in Wisconsin, the accident happened in Illinois, and Longhorn is owned by a company in Florida it had to go through federal court in Wisconsin.  The federal court cap on cases like mine is $25,000.  
Longhorn’s lawyers told my lawyer they would offer $12,000.  THEY SAID IF I WERE UNMARRIED THEY WOULD OFFER MORE, BUT BECAUSE I WAS MARRIED IT DIDN’T MATTER WHAT I LOOK LIKE NOW!  If I took it to court I would have to pay for expert witnesses for $5,000 dollars apiece and a new lawyer that could go to federal court in Wisconsin.  I would probably end up with less then $12,000.  My bills have not even been covered.  I am now living with:
-a permanent dent in my forehead
-nerve damage
-irreversible soft tissue damage
-hair loss because of the nerve damage
-my right eyebrow is gone because of nerve damage
-blurry vision
-I had lasik eye surgery before the accident and right after had to get glasses
-I now get horrible headaches
-In my right eye, below the impact site, the focusing mechanism sometimes locks and gives me double vision.  This recently sent me to the ER and I was told it is the result of the head injury.
-I miss 9 days of work

I signed the settlement because I had to get the bills paid.  I refused to sign the nondisclosure part of the agreement.  I told them they did not pay me enough to keep my mouth shut.  Their lawyer shrugged that off and said to cross it off the agreement.  I guess he didn’t realize how loud this little Special Education teacher could be.  

My lawyer negotiated agreements with my doctors to lower the amount of my bills.  They agreed and accepted the payments.  My hospital then decided to resubmit the amount they agreed not to get back to my insurance, from my employer at the time of the accident.  They are now demanding $3,710 back because they found out I got a settlement.  
I have not been been able to pay to get any of my issues fixed.  
I am now in the hole because I went to dinner at Longhorn Steakhouse.  They do not treat their customers right and do not follow through on their promises.  They do not take responsibility for their actions.  
Please help me by not eating at Longhorn Steakhouse and reposting my VERY long post.  They need to understand that they have seriously affected my life, and how they handled it was very wrong.  They need to make this right.

708,eq2nz4,People keep assuming that I shave my head to support the fight against cancer,"I’ve shaved my head every time I cut my hair for the last 11 or 12 years. It started when I joined the Marines. Even after I earned a little seniority, and wasn’t required to go bald, I just found it easier. And paying a one time fee of $25 for clippers is a lot cheaper than weekly haircuts. I don’t cut my hair as frequently now, but I still go bald when I do. And I’ve been stopped at least a dozen times by people who think I’m supporting the fight against cancer. That’s only about once a year, but it’s still too often for my liking. . I always explain that it’s simply a choice based on convenience and frugality. And, almost without fail, they get a disappointed look on their face and things get awkward. It’s not like I like cancer or anything. I’ve had a couple family members die from it and it’s a disgusting disease. I’m just not actively fighting it through my fashion choices, or lack thereof. I wish that people would stop assuming that I am naive enough to shave my head, thinking it could actually make people any more aware of cancer than they already are. I’m really just a thrifty, slightly lazy bald guy. Last week’s encounter was the worst yet. I was at the convenience store, standing in line. A lady in front of me noticed my newly shaven head and sparked a conversation. Assuming my motivations, she began telling me about a fundraiser she was participating in to fight breast cancer. She even asked me if I’d like to participate. She seemed quite excited and I didn’t want to burst her bubble. I entertained her and asked where it was. She provided me with a phone number, representing the organization hosting the event. I told her I would try to be there. I lied. I actually got out of line and pretended to have forgotten something. Why? Because I was about to buy a pack of smokes, and I wanted to make sure she was gone before I asked the cashier for it. I hate the disappointed look people give me when they realize I’m not an activist. I’ve resorted to lying. I feel like an awful person. I just don’t understand why people’s minds automatically go there. At least they don’t assume I’m a neo nazi, I guess. Anyway, just needed to get that out. Thanks for reading.",1579278642.0,8

It sucks that I'm in this position.

Since I'm slightly below the manager I told my manager about it because I feel like others feelings are getting hurt. There's one co-worker A that doesn't like another coworkers work ethic B and she told someone else C and that someone else told the co-worker B. Coworker B supposedly got fed up and try to talk it out with co-worker A. now this is all he said she said stuff so I don't know what's actually true but I do know one of my coworkers likes to exaggerate the truth and talk a lot. So of course when I told my manager she wanted me to listen names. I don't feel comfortable doing that because I don't know the whole story and I don't know if any of this is even true so I didn't want to seem like a gossip. But of course they want me to throw people under the bus 🤦 I was just giving her a heads-up about what possibly been going on and she wanted names.

The user commented and asked:

""***At the end of the day trump was born a human baby like the rest of us. What allows him to sleep at night with all this hanging over his head. Look at what Michael Jackson needed.""***

To which I replied: ""***Wish Trumps doctor was Conrad Murray.""***

I was perma banned for advocating ""Violence or Death"" to which I call BS. What follows is the thread im having with one of the mods of that sub: What I say is in bold.

\[–\]to /r/politics sent 2 hours ago

**This WILL fall on deaf ears but, I would like to remind you that Conrad Murray was charged and convicted of ""involuntary"" manslaughter which, by it very nature, suggests that Mr. Murray did not willfully wish ""violence or death"" (as what you are suggesting ive done) upon anyone.**

**So, for** r/politics **mods to suggest that my comment somehow wishes the same for the president is ludicrous and my ban is therefore without merit.**

**How my comment is interpreted by other users is opinion and its your job to remain unbiased.**

\[–\]subreddit message via /r/politics\[M\] sent an hour ago

You wished death. That’s why you were banned.

\[–\]to /r/politics sent an hour ago

**Thats your biased opinion.**

**I would like you to prove with the information provided that I wished for his death.**

**It could be argued that I simply want the President to get a good nights sleep with the help of Dr. Murray. The same way Michael Jackson hired him to help him sleep which turned out tragic.**

**I advise you to take a look at the users comment to which i replied too because it says verbetim: ""What allows him to sleep at night with all this hanging over his head. Look at what Michael Jackson needed.""**

**Furthermore, because it seems like i have to explain it. What Michael Jackson needed was Conrad Murray to administer the drug Propofol to help him sleep, not ""wish violence or death"" on him.**

**Your ban is without merit.**

Now regardless of what i meant by my comment and wether the mod got it right or not is irrelevant because two arguments could be made from my comment and the entirety of r/politics is a place for debate/opinion.

Anyway, i know the mods arent gonna rescind my ban, but if i can stop one person from using that sub as a platform for anything then i consider that a win.

#WHY?! 

Actual fucking human fucking people are still fucking getting their fucking houses and shit burned down and cunts are still fucking DYING. WHY THE FUCK ARE WE GIVING EVEN THE _SLIGHTEST_ OF FUCKS ABOUT FUCKING SKIPPY AND BLINKY FUCKING BILL WHEN CUNTS ARE FUCKING DYING?! 

Fuck the wildlife. If you do ANYTHING for the wiLdLiFE and not the fucking HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAD FUCKING LIVES AND FAMILIES BEING ROASTED ALIVE then you're just a fucking *idiot*. Granted, not as much of a fucking idiot as Scomo but you're still a fucking idiot. 

If you, as someone who sent aid to the wildlife and not the people, had to look the families of Geoffrey Keaton and Andrew O'Dwyer in the eye and say ""Your sons are fucking dead because we value Skippy the bush kangaroo more than them,"" I don't think you'd be fucking smiling. And if I were the one being told that *I'd rip your fucking throat out*.

And another grievance I have -- I have to go to church with the fam so I don't get disinherited and every fucking week I see old mate up the front ""praying"" to big boss in charge about helping the firefighters. If you _pray_ about it and don't _actually send aid_, you're a fucking hypocrite, and if you're praying in front of others and still not sending aid, you're a _self righteous hypocrite_ and you're profiteering off the deaths of innocents and heroes for your own reputation. If that's you, then just know that the whole world hates you :)

So in short, don't stop sending shit to help the RFS but if what you're sending doesn't directly help put out a fire or save someone from a burning building, you're disrespecting the RFS, people who have lost their homes and people who have lost their lives. And you're a moron.

Instead of teaching the child responsibility and discipline for her actions, they just rewarded her until she got her way. My friend just got tired of the tantrums and is just letting her stay home.

739,ek897j,Australia is woefully unprepared for bushfires.,"For a country that seems to get serious bushfires every ten years or less we are in no way prepared for them happening. Our government always seems to be caught with its pants down and that needs to stop. The Australian government needs to come up with something big in order to combat the fires and provide relief and shelter on a moment's notice. I'm no expert by any means, nor can I run a federal budget however here's what I'd do:

1) Have all people on the dole (unemployment benefits) trained in firefighting, logistics, relief and communications where their level of fitness/health and skills are appropriate. I'd sooner hire somebody who helped the country in a time of crisis so it helps increase employability.

2) Have the military trained in these scenarios to help fight fires and provide relief.

3) Invest more in bushfire fighting technologies such as water bombers and development of new ways to fight fire on such a grand scale.

4) Start running canals of sea water inland to strategic locations where water may be needed and quickly accessed for firefighting and in times of drought, have water treatment to provide normal drinkable water the rest of the time so it has a use all the time. Yes this does have an effect on flora and fauna however bushfires do worse. If done, this may cause more areas to have greener vegetation and perhaps make the region more tropical in way of climate but tropics are less likely to burn.

5) Better financial assistance for volunteers who go without income in order to fight fires.

6) Legal reform to ensure that insurance companies are made to pay for insured bushfire damaged homes and property. No loopholes.

7) Each town that has a high risk of bushfires (easy to deduce which, ask the fire services or conduct risk assessments) to have underground shelters with separate air supply and a lot of normal supplies for people to escape to if caught in an inescapable fire situation. Much akin to a tornado shelter just with airlocks and sealed off to prevent fire sucking out the oxygen and low enough down to insulate against heat.

A plan of this scale is insanely expensive but the government makes at current around $120 billion a year on tobacco tax revenue, they could do it if they set their minds to it.",1578199715.0,1

I'm a home cook and I know how to cook despite being quite young, and Jesus Christ when I say that that bitch cannot take an opinion at hand (yeah she double times as my cook whenever our regular cook is unavailable) and she even proceeds to scream her head off at me whenever I suggest anything.

Today, I had woken up really early to go to school for a presentation, and my parents had gone out without telling me that they had gone, so while I was asleep (yeah I sleep a lot during the day) she begins knocking heavily on the door, despite my parents telling her not to disturb me, and the only thing she fucking woke me up for is to ask whether she needs to hang the clothes from the washing machine or not. 

My room door is closed right now but I'm literally crying from pain and I genuinely wish death upon this bitch.",1578139410.0,2
742,eiwz51,My school would never shut up about Australia's history and it annoys me.,"Hear me out here: I dont think Australia's history isnt important. It's just that it gets incredibly annoying to listen to. Let me explain:
So I'll be sitting there in class, trying to pay attention when the teacher brings up Australia's history and the stolen generation for the 500th time. Now if you don't know what that is, basically in the 1700s, Britain was dumping convicts over to this other little continent which would eventually become known as Australia. Now there was a law back then which stated that if there was an island or continent that had no one on there, it was a No Man's Land so they were allowed to claim it. But there were already Aboriginals there and basically they stole their kids and taught them white ways, you get it. Very important history for Australia. Now you think explaining it once or twice and maybe doing a small assesment on it would be enough, right? Hahaha NO. They just kept going on and on about the same story over and over and over like a broken record. They made us constantly do worksheets about it in English which felt more like history lessons. We had to constantly analyse it over and over and it got so boring that the message was just non existant at that point and i just wanted it to be over. For a multi cultral school it really felt like it was only all about Australia and nothing else. Like, I get it. Dont be racist. Don't do whatever that was. See? It's lost its point.
Maybe I wanna learn about how knights invaded castles or how they poured boiling oil on top of them so they had to climb up the toilets, stab them in the ass. How they catapaulted heads over the castle walls and how they shot arrows over thatd catch on fire. Maybe I wanna learn about World War 2 and how they had to cook lice just to entertain themselves or how they had to pee on their shoes to not get blisters. The disgusting food they ate and the conditions they lived in. Hell, I learned more about the world from Horrible Histories! A damn TV show! Yes I know, political jabbering is very important, now can we get to the juicy stuff? Australia isnt the only place oit there that has history yknow, howd we get from Vikings to this?",1577963482.0,4

747,eia6z4,My last complaint of the decade,"I’m entering the next decade clean, and since I only have half an hour left of the decade I’m making my final complaint of the decade this:

Keep in mind, this will address an issue that has lasted for way more than a decade so this will be very long 

It may be hard to see what’s a complaint and what’s not, but if I get angry at some point it’s probably the actual complaint/punchline of the complaint or whatever.

So I was born into a very odd family situation, both my parents came from previous relationships/divorces and had multiple kids from that. This isn’t the odd part though. My dads kids were adults already and one of them had kids of their own. That was odd to other kids, but I dealt with it.

No, the part that was odd was mostly my moms situation. Her past relationship was really ugly. When she was pregnant with my brother the dad left to go with another woman, and when my dad came in the picture a few years later he suddenly got jealous and wanted his son back. I don’t remember what happens next, but things escalated fast and eventually my moms ex managed to make everyone turn against my mom and so she sent my brother to him for a year to prove his dad was lying etc.

Things escalated even more from there and eventually he (her ex) started keeping him (son) from seeing her and keeping him from contacting her somehow. I was born in the middle of that odd situation, and I grew up into that. Also, forgot to mention, but this situation also pissed off my dads adult kids so that made it worse.

Timeskip to first grade (we’re still not at the complaint part, told you this would be long) and the situation grows harder to ignore considering all our schoolwork at the time was telling about our family. Our homework used to be read out loud by the teacher pretty often, and my very questionable and visibly kind of upset answers kind of got me in trouble to be honest. I knew the situation wasn’t like it was supposed to be and eventually I had to speak out because of all the questions that arose from my first grade assignments. It was probably an attempt to comfort me, but eventually I got nonstop corrected by the other kids. “HALF brother.” “Chill out, they’re not your REAL siblings etc.”

It really just made the situation more tense for me. 

Eventually as I grew older and as I passed through multiple phases of my life I accepted it as a fact. I had little contact With the two oldest ones because of conflict, and the other one was a missing piece I assumed would remain missing. I had come to peace with it,

Well eventually things calmed down everywhere, and all those years being told by everyone “they’re not your real siblings” etc really made it hard for me when things actually calmed down.

Another small timeskip because I’m running out of time, to present time.

I now at least know two of them, but because of everyone I still refer to them as half siblings.

Here’s the complaint. 

In the meantime, a lot of those kids got half siblings of their own who they now love to death and that’s when trouble arose for me. Earlier this year (soon last year) I was talking to my friend who corrected me a few times when we were small, way before his brother was born. I happened to mention my brother, and of course I said half brother, because that’s what I’ve been taught by him and just about everyone else we know. 

His response? “Geez, can you not say that? HaLf bRoTher? Just call him your brother, half brother is very offensive and excluding”

Well Jesus Christ then can I not even say that now? And you’re the one telling me out of all people and in that exact way too? You’re the one who taught me this bullshit at least let me get used to not saying it at my own speed fucking hell, it would have cost you zero dollars not to say that

Yeah that’s about it, I’m running out of time, badly written but yeah, last complaint of the decade cya next decade",1577832911.0,1
748,ei9wrk,nothing is going my way on winter break and I'm about to lose it(long),"
hello. I have been trying to keep myself together recently. It is a hard time of year for me already as my grandmother passed away today almost a decade ago so it's always a bit grim for me personally, on Christmas Eve I saw her have an aneurysm and I was home alone so it's a recurring memory that often comes up during Christmas time.

For Christmas I asked for a camera to make videos with so I can record semi-professional educational videos for my YouTube channel... I got a $40 webcam instead. Then I tried making a green screen using some green poster board using my phone as the camera and the webcam, and the green screen did not work at all after using it for around 6 hours. 

Mom was snooping through my room to clean up and found a box of hidden unused condoms and it has put a strain on our relationship and gave me a lecture right before Christmas Day ended after picking up from my gf's place. She wasn't too mad but I felt the disappointment from her(because she's religious) and the interrogation left a sour taste in my mouth for Christmas. 

I got inspired to make a story after watching the new Star Wars movie about a historical fiction mystery in medieval times about magic intervening with an ancient prophecy, one of my friends hasn't even bothered reading what I wrote and the other said it was cliché. So I just didn't even bother to finish writing it.

I spent most of my break playing Minecraft building the Hanging Gardens of Babylon only for my friends to criticize it being uneven on the second layer(I want to throw him off a cliff) after several days of construction. Also most of the machines I tried to make ended up being a waste of time and I have been wasting time on adventures looking for certain tools or resources which apparently take 4x as longer than my friends to find.

I applied to two colleges for on-sites, they said they would give in my financial aid package and letter of admission by the New Year and haven't, I'm getting outraged day by day knowing that it still isn't here and it's already New Year's Eve. 

I made a review sheet, helped other people out for a test of an area where I am using proficient in and learned I just passed and my grade dropped 10 points. Whenever I try to explain to people I got a bad grade they just tell me to shut up so I doubt they believe me and I am furious at myself for letting myself slip like that.

I wanted to apply to online tutor to save some money up for a camera and future tuition, but I currently did not meet any qualification standards of multiple websites I looked into and am not going to bother trying anymore.

Girlfriend invited me to dinner with her parents for New Year's Eve, I asked my mom for permission, she didn't like the idea and then she said she would ask my dad for his approval. No response, I wait and wait and I ask again and now she guilt tripped me into staying at home just half an hour before my gf's dinner invitation begins. I'm staying not because I want to but I was unofficially forced to. Girlfriend was angry at me telling her so late about the response but my mom failed to communicate in time and now I'm extra pissed off for taking more heat.

I am genuinely sad knowing most of my break was wasted learning and doing stuff that would only be criticized/inefficient and not fun. I have felt sick for the last week on and off with an ongoing headache. I am lacking in resources to pursue my creative projects, I am lacking qualifications for jobs online that I wish to do, I am lacking in support and appreciation from my peers and family, I am not getting the information I need from colleges and I'm outraged. No one wants to hear my complaints and people think I'm just spoiled brat and overdramatize everything. If someone says anything else I'm about to go ape on them and I'm already extremely bitter.

I just want to go back to school already, my teachers are my constant source of happiness and I just need to be around them for enthusiasm, support & appreciation that I have been lacking...",1577831543.0,2
749,ei7znx,Wasteful.,"Ugh. So I need to do laundry today. 
MIL hadn't left for work at her usual time (for someone who complains about not having money and can't miss anymore work she sure doesn't fucking go to work.)
She started the wash before she left the house, which was like 11. So I just assumed she wasn't going to work. Well she did go to work. For 3 hours. 
I go ahead and decided to do my laundry anyway, I'll just throw her stuff into the dryer. I open the wash and guess what she washed? One fleece pull over and a rag. Ugh.
She also does this thing where she starts the wash but doesn't close the lid so her laundry just sits there and festers in the water until someone closes the lid.

750,ei6up5,I'm really starting to resent my body,"I've been working out since I was 17, (21 now), and I'm really starting to resent my body. I ENJOY exercise, but the problem is that every single freaking time I start exercising, I injure myself without fail.

I took some time off running because I'd given myself a soft tissue injury in my knee, most likely from standing all day at work. Then when I decided to go back into it, I pull my right hip flexor. Fine, so I take another break of a few weeks. Hip flexor seems fine. I decide to go swimming; after a length of breast stroke it's fecked again. Its the same story with my left wrist: everything's going fine, then I do the littlest thing wrong, and then I can't lift weights with that arm because it hurts like fecking hell. Squats? Good luck, my knees hate me for those. Deadlift? Nope, my lower back always gets pissed with me. Even my NECK is grumpy because the sternocleidomastoid muscle on my left side is so tight, I can't pull my head all the way over my shoulders without going deaf in one ear.

Stretching should theoretically help, right? Loosen everything up? Well, that screws me over because something always goes wrong there as well. I seem to always go a little too far with the stretch. Everything feels fine until I come out of the stretch, and then I can't bend over because my hamstrings are pissed at me.

It's not like my form is shit either. I've gone to physio, I've had my lifts evaluated. They're alright. Apparently it's just impossible for me to judge how much I should be lifting or something.

The most recent thing was my right hip flexor from swimming, and now I can't freaking walk without pain. I even warmed up! I swear I did! What's really rich is that I was trying to take it EASY! It's why I was doing breast stroke in the first place! Because it's EASY. It's why I've only been doing body weight exercises! Too bad my knee is fecked too because even with body weight squats, I'll occasionally come out of a squat to be greeted with sharp pain in my right knee, and then I can't squat again for a month!

The thing that pisses me off the most is that I want to be exercising. I'm having to skip out on martial arts practice now because my hip flexor is buggered. I can't run because of it either. I'm starting to hate myself because of it.

I just can't get over the fact that I'm twenty-one years old, and I feel like I'm seventy. Something is ALWAYS hurting. I'm NEVER totally pain free, and when I am pain free and think I can start working out again, WHOOPS! Looks like I wasn't healed after all because now my body hates me again.

And its not even like I over train. If anything, I'm UNDER training because I'm always freaking broken! 

It doesn't help that my job is as a lifeguard, so every single fecking time I hurt myself, that's more time for me to fall out of shape and potentially have to deal with a heart attack in deep water with a fecked up hip flexor, or knee, or wrist, or whatever the feck it is because it's always fecking something.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just doomed to be fecked over like this for my whole life.

The bottom line: I'm absolutely sick of how I'm in a perpetual state of injury and how it feels like those injuries are compounding and getting worse as time goes on.",1577817435.0,1

752,ehz04g,"HealthNet PPO won't cover OON until I pay $25,000","I have been seeing a psychiatrist for years who doesn’t accept insurance. After decades of therapy and medicine she’s the first doctor who I’ve actually made progress with. So it’s important that I continue to work with her. 

At my last job I enrolled myself in a PPO plan through Aetna. After I hit my deductible they reimbursed me 60% for my visits. All I had to do was send them the invoice.

I just left my job to start my own thing and signed up for Health Insurance through HealthNet. Again, I selected the more expensive PPO plan so they’d cover OON after I hit my deductable. 

Just to be sure I checked their FAQ. Here’s a network from, “**Am I covered if I seek medical care outside the network?”** 

In a PPO plan, you can use doctors, hospitals and other health care providers that belong to your plan's network, or you can get care from an out-of-network Medicare provider. It may cost you more to go out-of-network.

I signed up. But, I ran into problems when I spoke with them.

According to a couple people there (including the supervisor), HealthNet PPO doesn’t cover OON costs until you pay $25,000. Yep. A $5k deductible (which is fine), but then a $20,000 OOP thing. And for that, only 50% of what I pay would start chipping away at that cost. This is no matter what.

When I asked why would anyone pay $360/mo for this he said he had to find his talking points. He couldn’t find his talking points.

Does that make any sense? 

I didn’t use my insurance last month and my payment went through for the following month. To get a refund I have to go through some grievance process, which is as unnecessarily complicated as you’d expect.

754,ehkmsc,Selling Or Buying A House,"If you plan on buying or selling your house, do some homework and then prepare yourself for a Boot Camp experience that will go on for at least six weeks to months.

You need to know that real estate agencies and attorneys work together with the banks or mortgage companies - but often as antagonists. As these three groups come together to get your house sold or to help you buy a new house - they often clash to your detriment.

And never lose sight of the fact that they will have a good payday at closing.

And guess who pays the bills?

FIRST: Try and sell it yourself! Do whatever you can to sell house without a realtor. You can do it. But you will need to find a lawyer to handle the legal work - New York state is just one of many who require attorneys to conduct real estate deals.

If you manage to get a buyer, you will be signing a purchase agreement which can be found online - but is fairly standard. It reads to protect both buyer and seller. But remember that things like black mold, faulty furnaces, roofs that need repair or replacement, and the big one - water in the cellar - are all going to be your responsibility. However, without a real estate agent, you can get an inspection done before you sell and present it to the buyers when they make He can get his own inspection, but if you get one first - he will know what the flaws are and you can renegotiate the price right then and there.

SECOND: Now you'll need a lawyer. And here's where you get screwed. They all do real estate - it's simple work and follows specific patterns depending on the laws, statutes, and regulations in the city, town, county, etc. The thing is - lawyers are ALWAYS BUSY. They get bogged down in dozens if not hundreds of small and large legal activities that often put your job on the back burner. Also - much of what they do is hampered by the BANK/MORTGAGE companies - who also have lawyers. They're not going to give the buyer any money until they are positive that the house and property are lien-free and have no pending legal liabilities.

And this is where you get screwed. Your deal could sit in limbo as the bank and attorneys call, fax, and email each other over deed filings, abstract searches, and the search for potential liens on the property. This is why it takes 4 weeks (dream on) to 12 weeks (and sometimes much longer) to actually close on a house so you can get your money to buy your new house - which will be another 4 to 12 weeks once you begin the process.

In short - if you're a seller - prepare for a 3 to 4 month ordeal when your life and that of your family becomes a living nightmare of frustration, expense, and anger.

So - who do we blame the most?

The attorneys are a big part of the problem because they follow strict procedures on real estate deals. The banks are a bigger part of the problem because they aren't going to lend anybody any money unless they're sure they'll get their monthly payment. The realtors, I believe, are slightly more responsible, because they have the POWER to move the other two agencies along. Realtors should be checking with the bank and the attorney on a weekly basis - but probably every three days. The agent has the names and the phone numbers and the time to go to the bank and check on the status.

But in the real world - once they get your signature on that purchase offer - they couldn't care less if it takes four weeks or 12 weeks - they're going to get their fee; and less time spent on your case is more time for them to be showing houses to other buyers.

THIRD: If you do go with a realtor - NEVER - EVER - agree to anything more than SIX PERCENT. In fact you should try to get them down to FIVE right at the get-go. Then - make sure you've got a clause in that agreement that says if the buyer doesn't get his commitment letter from the bank/mortgage company within four weeks - you have the right to terminate the agreement and can begin looking for a new buyer.",1577702908.0,1

Perhaps, just per FUCKING HAPS I SHOULD USE MY FUCKING HANDS AND KNOCK ON THE FUCKING DOOR""?

It doesn't make a great fucking deal of sense though when you tell ME to fuck off and instead hire THIS FUCKING MELON who DOESN'T RING THE FUCKING DOORBELL WHEN DELIVERING A FUCKING PARCEL.

Somehow it was forgotten (amongst a lot of other things but I thought forgetting that would be impossible considering I wrote it down pretty early) and I got kinda sad, but I got money for Christmas so I decided to buy that and some other things that were forgotten

And stores finally opened up again just today, but then I found out that no store in this entire country (I’m not American) has it in physical form. And the one single online shop (in this country) that you can buy it from and delivers fast is sold out from Black Friday 

Eventually after looking in every possible shop and online I figured I would just buy it on the Nintendo EShop because I have no patience left, so what it’s 2 dollars more than buying it from a store in a foreign country and waiting a month for it? At least I’ll get it instantly and then I can exchange friend codes with my friends.

But nope, Nintendickface has other plans. I go to the EShop and search up the game and click “purchase” and I get the option to either add EShop currency with an EShop card or to do it with a credit card, because apparently I can’t just give credit card information like a normal person

Anyways I choose credit card because I don’t have an EShop card and I’ve never been a huge Nintendo person because my DS games from my childhood were weird originals from my country and not a lot of Nintendo 

And when I choose credit card it tells me to go to a website that tells me how to do it

First thing on the website? “As of blah blah blah you can no longer do this”

Ah yes lovely well what the fuck am I supposed to do then? Why did you give me the option then? Jesus

So I searched online for an hour and everything was either sold out, not correct currency or closed 

So to whoever came up with the idea of not just giving credit card info or removing the credit card option to get currency over to the account, take your idea, crumble it into a ball, cover it with honey, shove it up your arse and then sit on an anthill

But the doctor he's seeing was out of the country. And him not spending Christmas with me makes me depressed. I cried today because he doesn't want to spend Christmas with me. I hope he spends Christmas with me. Christmas is important to me. I told him that it would mean a lot him spending Christmas with me. He said maybe to spending Christmas with me. But his maybe almost always means he won't do something with me. Spending Christmas with friends And family is important to me. And to make things worse he said he wanted to talk to me and my parents after the holidays. I'm scared of a breakup. I asked him if he was breaking up with me he said he's not sure. If he breakesup with me I'm going to be depressed because no other guy wants to date me. I'm undatable to other guys. If he breaks up with me I'll feel like I'm destined to be alone for the rest of my life and that I never going to get married. And if he breaks up with me he's going to throw away a four month relationship just like that I can't live with myself knowing that. I can't live with myself if he breaks up with me. If he breaks up with me I can't live myself feeling like that I'm destined to be a lone for the rest of my life and that I'm never going to get married. I don't want to be a lone for the rest of my life and have the feeling that I'm never going to get married. If we break up I'm going to blame my Autism for the break up. I love my boyfriend and I can't break up. I can't let him go I love him too much. And if we break up and if he would ever get another girlfriend I couldn't live with myself knowing I might not have been good enough for him and that he doesn't love and care about me even though he does love and care about me. And now I hate Christmas because my boyfriend might not spend Christmas with me. I just hate everything right now. I'm not ok. I just wish I could hide from world right now because I'm so depressed.,1577302931.0,0
763,ef9tuk,I hate my sister,"She is a self proclaimed gold digger. She says it is their fault for giving her money. Everything is always about her, every single time. She hogs the bathroom, and even forced me to piss in a bottle once. If I take longer than five minutes in the bathroom though, she will force the lock open on me. She gives little to nothing for Bill's and rent. She takes my food without asking if I got some for her. Shes so stupid, she fell for some dude promising to get her rich, which forced her to close her bank account. She is also narcissistic, always telling you about her ""achievements"" with out being asked to. When she graduated college, she swore up and down she wanted to move away to be a real grown up and move on, but one visit to her university caused her to drop it, stay home, and go to a community college. All her applications cost my mom a lot of money, which she has so little off. She made my mother pay for her limo during prom night and even a dess. Again, we cant afford that shit. She defended one of her friends after they scammed me for some money. She blackmails my little sister with exposing her secrets if she doesnt let her use a little backpack my brother bought for her. She is 8, what secrets could she have? Anyways, these are some of the many things I hate about her.",1577235617.0,7
764,ef9dv2,Unispaces ripoff,"Hello. I wanted to ask if it there is any forum website or social service or application where i can post a warning for people who are about to use a service that im currently using ,more than this, I would definitely want to know if me and my young daughter could be saved of this nightmare por favour,hear my story: About 4 days ago I have booked an apartment via Unispaces which at first I didn't know much about but quite quickly i have learnt that it was basically a service for students ,where you can trace vacancies around the world. Since ive arrived to lisbon in the worst possible timing of the year. Being disappointed with airbnb i set down and booked a place for my family and myself for a really long period (1 month) in an apartment that looked rather bright and spacious in the pictures. As i went on with the booking process ive started feeling slightly uncomfortable seeing there weren't any options at all mentioning children,not at any stage (being so familiar with other services such as ""Booking"" ""Tripadvisor"" ""AirBnb"" and others) something that made me right before confirmation to cancel the whole thing although I was very stressed with time,and then I googled ""uniplace"" and yes i felt ok it wasn't made for families it was cool to cancel it and move on to ""spotahome"" and so I did,stressed up because of the time impact (we had to checkout in a different apartment)...and then the phone rang and there was ×××× from ""unispaces"" client support ,he sounded very promising and after a rather long chat he convinced me that the apartment I have canceled could most certainly be appropriate for a family to be staying at for a whole month,since I am a rather suspicious by nature i kept stretching the fact that children are involved and that my husband and son will be joining us within 2 weeks arriving from Tokyo and that the place really really must be suitable because we are working from home etc etc and ×××× assured me there is nothing to be worried about. The house was available starting aug 2st.so we had to find a place for 4 more days (we means myself and my 8 year old daughter). And so we arrived today,we were 22 minutes late and as we entered the house (which looked not exactly like the pictures (oh yes yes! The policy of ""Uniplaces"" does not allow to visit the property before renting it (this too i've found out only after renting the place) I now know why. So aside for the fact that the apartment turned into half a basement (our ""kitchen window"" is in the height of our neighbours garden in his garden) there's a smell of moss and sewer in the air (landlord saying the only thing that can be done about it is pouring some bleach in the toilet...well there are children in the house. I wanted kindly ,if i get back to the mare reason for this rather tedious post is to ask where is it possible to warn other people with families regarding this service What can I do if there is any possibility at all to cancel the whole thing.this is a complete rip off and it costs 500euros for the service leave alone the rent price itself.

When I asked to cancel (it took far less than an hour )I received the following email:

Dear Orro,

I hope you are well.

Thank you for contacting us.

We are sorry to hear that you are having issues related to your new accommodation.

Given that the listing does not specify that it is a ""family"" apartment, unfortunately I cannot validate this particular complaint as there is no discrepancy in the listing. The description states that it is a perfect place for a ""student experience"" and it does not specify that is it is specifically for families.

Regarding the smell of mould in the bathroom, we can contact the landlord to ask if he could find a way to resolve this. Perhaps it is a question of him arranging a more thorough clean and making sure that the room is sufficiently aerated.

If you do decide to move-out, please bear in mind that in this case we will not be able to refund you as your complaint regarding the suitability of the apartment for families is more subjective and is not due to any discrepancy in the listing.

If you wish to remain in the apartment, please let me know and we will contact the landlord to help resolve the issue in the bathroom.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Sophie

765,ef8dr4,Subreddit design makes bubbles,"TIL that you have a karma rating on each subreddit.  And, a low karma rating causes posting delays.

I have many opinions,  as do we all.  I enjoy reaching out of my subreddit comfort zone and debating with people who have different opinions.  I try to be civil, and usually am.  And I always get downvoted for expressing an opinion different from the prevailing one.

So, now I have a posting delay on a couple subreddits.  The very subs where I have the most responses.  These are redditors,  anxious for my sage and worldly guidance.  And, with an 8 minute delay each, it takes hours to reply to each one.  

It looks to me as if Reddit was designed with this feature to promote its users living in information bubbles. Never hearing well reasoned opinions different from their own.

The learning possibilities that are being quashed are staggering. 

I expect no solutions.  This is clearly a feature desired by Reddit's designers.  If such personal opinion bubbles are the cause of some upcoming conflict,  we can let history be the judge of Reddit.",1577227985.0,0
766,een45g,Let me convince you to never order from DHL," 

I  bought a present for my nephew and asked the shop to deliver to a DHL  service point. This was on November 29th, well in time for Sinterklaas (a dutch holiday similar to santa clause). According to the shop, I could pick it up the  next day at the service point.

Being  the good-faithed person I am, I went to the pickup point. No luck. But  that can happen right, sometimes things are a bit later. Though  according to the track and trace the package was ready for pickup. So I  come back the next day and then the next, still nothing. By now I'm a  bit worried, so I try to chat with DHL. In this conversation they  basically tell me that they don't know what's going on and that the only  way to find this out is to contact the shop and have the shop start an  investigation. So I contact the shop and the shop tells me that the  package is set to be returned to the shop and that they will try to send  it again once they receive it, so essentially they are waiting on DHL.

Then  complete radio silence for the rest of the week. At some point I get in  touch with DHL chat again to ask if my package has been sent back yet.  They tell me it has not and that I should contact the shop (even though  all I want is for the package to be delivered at either the service  point or my home). So I contact the shop and beg them to start an  investigation so that DHL can do something. This investigation takes a  week and by the end the shop tells me DHL will come to deliver the  package again at my home address.

Not  wanting to miss the package I check the times during which they should  arrive and I arrange with work to work from home for those hours.  Unfortunately I cannot work from home all day and so I have to get to  work at some point.  As can be expected by this point, they do not  arrive in the timeframe that they specified, so I miss them, they leave a  note saying they will come by next day. This happens the next day too.  Then it is saturday, I stay home all day; no delivery, no note.

On  Monday I get into a chat again and the person on the other end tells me  that the package has been delivered at the servicepoint and  that I should pick it up there. Not having a car, getting to this  servicepoint and then bringing home the package would be a bitch of a  task. But I do it. I go to the service point.

Once  there the people tell me that the package went out with the deliveries  and that I should hurry home. They called the driver and asked if he  could wait in the parking lot and take his break there. So I come home,  15 minutes ahead of schedule and 15 minutes before the driver should be  there. I wait for 45 minutes in the cold for a delivery van to come but  nothing happens.

Irritated, I call  the DHL service number and I get someone on the line who cannot help me  and then transfers me to another person. I tell this person my story  and the first thing she says is ""That is not possible, we never do  things this way"". I tell her to call the Utrecht office and ask them;  turns out after a certain hour the service points stop picking up the  phone altogether, she said this was normal. Then I ask her what to do,  since by now it has been roughly 4 weeks since I ordered the package and  as of tomorrow I will be going away and so today is pretty much the  last day I can get the package. Her answer was to contact the shop and  have them start an investigation.

I  don't think I have ever been this angry at a company (or anything  really) and I just want everyone to know what a horrible shitshow DHL is  in the Netherlands.",1577120097.0,4

788,eb7rkm,A rant against Internet/Cable companies that are screwing people over.,"Before I start this rant, I just want to say that I don't live in some rural area in the middle of nowhere. I live in a metropolitan area with over 4 million people and plenty of Fortune 500 companies, millionaires, and a booming middle class. Surrounded by 3 other huge cities, the city where I reside in is Houston. Yet despite having to deal with intense humidity, traffic, and constant construction, the one problem that is driving me out of my frickin mind is my internet. I've been with AT&T for 8 years now, and these past 3 weeks my internet has been getting worse and worse. In my room, the speed is .67 MBps!!! Do you know how slow that is? I can't even download a picture without waiting for half a minute. Can't complete my homework, can't watch Youtube tutorials, and forget about online gaming. My family has tried calling them numerous times, and they've said that faster internet is not available in our area. Our area?!! Are you kidding me? I've got thousands of people around me and I'm in a neighborhood where everyone uses the internet. To make it even worse, AT&T said that our router was old, so that might be the cause. We bought a new one, and our problems were solved. 

Just Kidding. 

The speed only increased to 1.7Mbps and they pretty much scammed us. I've had enough with this company and many others like it. Internet and broadband is a necessity in this day in age to receive information, texts, and do online homework assignments (not joking). And it's not like I live in the middle of nowhere! I live in the 4th biggest city in the USA! I recently saw the Patriot Act episode on Netflix at school over this issue and my frustration with American internet companies has only increased. Seriously, someone needs to fix this problem quickly. We need municipal broadband or for the FCC to grow a pair and start demanding that these companies stop screwing people over. 

Ok, all my anger is out. Hopefully, this Reddit message even goes through with my 1.7Mbps junky internet that my family spends good money on.",1576458291.0,2

Some gaming subs are fine and people just enjoy the game, but others can be down right terrible and just filled with a toxic community. There is one subreddit that really stands out and I haven't played the game since the developers gave into their demand. A certain playlist was removed from a rotation (as old playlists go, new ones come in that's how most games go) and the community DEMANDED the old playlist be put back or they wouldn't play. Its like seriously? To me that is real childish and the community is probably better off. I know developers need to keep the most amount of players as possible and what not but keep the new stuff up so players can get used to the new maps.

813,e6vsdz,Does anyone else share my annoyance w the pompousness and biased writing on the movie review site PluggedIn?,"What follows is  a  long-ass overdramatic post of me airing my grievances toward this stupid website for, really, no apparent reason...but fuck it, why not? Ok, don’t say I didn’t warn ya. Hopefully at least a couple ppl will share my same perspective. 

As a kid, my parents would use PluggedIn (used to be called PluggedInOnline I think) to screen literally every fucking movie I ever watched, even PG n G rated shit. When I would ask why I wasn’t allowed to see a certain movie, they would use that opportunity to bring up quotes that they read from that website, which would only piss me off even more and make me want to seek out an R-rated movie, which was an endeavor I was successful in once I found out the 24 hr convenient store dwn the st. sold both DVDs AND a portable DVD player... I would go dwn there several times a wk during the middle of the night to cop smutty  movies, blowing all my allowance $$ lol..damn I remember The movies I had were the fucking worst of the worst 😂

anyway I now look at PluggedIn & laugh at the over-exaggerations of how “crude” or “profane” certain scenes are. They make sex scenes sound like full on porn &censor out the words “damn”& “hell” like: (d**n/h*ll) Like isn’t the website 4 adults?! Lmao I just picture These uptight older folks unknowingly optimizing the stigma that Christians r hypocrites by watching the entire length of movies they criticize 4 being too vulgar..U don’t have to sit thru all of “Wolf of Wallstreet” to know it’s gonna not be suitable 4 children or ppl w Christian values...u can make this evaluation within the first 10 minutes of a movie like this, and every other raunchy comedy, especially when it has actors that are known for starring in these types of movies (E.g. Seth Rogen or Eddie Murphy) ...Just watch the first couple scenes, pick up on the vibe and realize it’s going to stay that way throughout the movie, and then write an unbiased, succinct, and plainly factual review for Christian parents... or whoever’s ur desired audience, explaining how the movie is obviously not suitable for children for “whatever reason: language , sex, etc.. Yet they watch these kinda movies unnecessarily from start 2 finish, immersing themselves in what they persuade others not to watch, their only excuse being the fact that they write for a movie review site. Well, a biased, right wing, pompous site that bashes good quality movies that have received A1 reviews elsewhere just bc they use.....hmmm ....how would they put it? “Naughty language.” Fuck these uppity hypocrites who think they’re better than others bc they don’t drink , only watch g-rated shit & probably helicopter their kids ...& like to use words normal ppl cant understand & have to look up in dictionaries. 

Theyve also Listed sum1 lighting a cigarette under “drug use” b4 Lol 😂😂& discussed ppl smoking weed as if it’s crack— (SON sum of the ways they’ve demonized weed in their reviews smh...it rly makes me cringe) i’ve Seen them list ppl urinating & sum1 cheating on a test under “Other Negative Elements” like hell nah now u odee’ing 😂😂even an overbearing parent not gonna give a flying fuck about sum1 peeing lmfaooo...They criticized and made the following quote about “Breaking Bad”: (yes, a TV show more suitable for adults, but nothing insanely graphic or perverse)

“But while Walt's tale can be taken as that powerful parable, the path we must take to get to the moral at the end is as dark and depraved as any we see on television. The violence and the murders and the sheer horror of this world is categorically oppressive, absolutely harrowing in its brutality and realism.”

They said this about “Ride Along”: (a somewhat suggestive movie for kids, I’ll admit, but again, nothing odee or vulgar)

“... not when a film is as predictable and crass as this one. The language here is lewd; the sexual allusions are blushingly bad; the morality is messed up; and the violence, while not grotesque, is unremitting.”

Woooow ok that’s a little much, chill tf out w the overstatements and flowery language only used to fill up space on the page and  manipulate ppl into not seeing movies they might actually be okay w their kids watching..but they don’t allow it bc they’re misinformed by reading this website that self-aggrandizes the religion they follow with their reviews full of lies & not-so-subtle jabs at anything that isn’t completely wholesome. All they do is simply over-promote and praise Christian movies and deem nearly every other movie as “unsuitable,” backed by a fucking essay-length “review”

Despite my annoyance w the site it makes me laugh how they write & The way they deprecate sometimes completely innocent subject matter. I feel parents who use this site & their children know abt it will just make their kids wanna seek out R-rated movies which is exactly what I wanted & Did successfully^^^for a couple yrs b4 being caught 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️

Unfortunately one of the floors got used to parking in that space/letting their friends park there. I left notes. I texted the landlord. Eventually he got ahold of them and told them to move their car.

I spoke directly with them and was extremely polite. I explained we were paying extra for the spaces and that them parking there blocked my roommate from using her own space in the garage. They seemed understanding and for awhile it stopped.

Now it's started up again and it just seems fucking pointless. They park there whenever they can and also have their friends park back there/create their own spaces.

The reason I was even looking at higher-end, nicer clothes - something I would normally NEVER do - was because my mother had offered to buy me ""two head-to-toe outfits, and don't worry about the price"". We aren't super close and she lives out-of-state, so I don't know that I've ever even mentioned my clothing issue to her. She just wanted to do something nice for Christmas, and I absolutely appreciate that.    

  

Cut to today when, after literal dozens of hours of searching, crying, and feeling awful about my body, I finally pulled together a list of staple professional pieces that I'd be comfortable in. I reached out to my mom and she hit me with ""Oh, we're actually going to send you $300. Is that enough?"" I didn't want to be bratty and rude as that is a lot of money and I don't really know their situation right now, so I said yes and thanked her profusely. However, it's really, really not, and I'd be shy nearly another $300.   

  

I already told my boss that I'd be stepping up my wardrobe, to which she said ""Oh thank god"", so I'm going to have to figure something out. I know this is the definition of a first-world problem, but it's humiliating not being able to match my peers with their beautiful, professional outfits.

818,e6mgdv,I should be glad they're pushing me away from more and more games but Blizzard is intent on pissing older system customers off.,"So I could deal with that I could not play retail WoW. I was excited for Classic, anyway, which is nothing like it. Whoops, can't play that, either, because they require the same spec updates even though I played all the way through until the end of WotLK with dial-up and a complete joke of a pre-built computer that is an ancient, unholy RELIC compared to other computers made in years EARLIER than it itself was.

I was going to play Hearthstone today but I saw that Deathwing was added to Heroes of the Storm. I hadn't much reason to check the game out for a good while because all I ever got to do was lose on the same two fucking maps instead of playing on any others, some of them I haven't even seen ONCE even though a lot of them were implemented on DAY FUCKING ONE! Fuck you, underground mines and DOUBLE GO TO RETARD HELL shitty raven tribute shitty nonsense! I have played the latter easily 98% of every single match I've ever gone into. I hear there's a hell-themed devil map, one where you can turn into a dragon statue knight thing, one where you're making an egyptian bug army and even more options yet, let alone patches which brought more maps since then!

But no, I've played probably a solid 100+ matches and I have to fucking wait around for idiots who don't prioritize objectives and we just have a dragged out, definitive loss unless someone disconnects really early on from the enemy team and the AI feeds the shit out of us.

So, moving on, Deathwing as a hero? Cool shit, I'm all-in on that one! WRONG! Can't play this game at ALL anymore because of some Metal-compatible device crap or another. So, yet another game I'm forced to uninstall and never play because no one's going to just give me $1200 for a decent rig I won't have to replace again in 2 or 3 years anyway (yeah, Canadian computer prices are absolutely insane compared to the U.S.).

What next? Is original Starcraft (not remastered) going to get an update that means I cannot play unless I'm connected to a new chat system Battlenet implements in the next year or two? Gonna add something to Hearthstone that isn't even related directly to that specific original game mode (Battlegrounds is already a complete joke) and say my graphics card is too old to play something I was in on at CLOSED. FUCKING. BETA?!?!

God fucking almighty, baby Jesus skewed on a hot iron poker, what is with this company being so absolutely insistent on making it so that we absolutely HAVE to upgrade our rigs for no reason other than to be asinine pricks that can't just admit that having an all-in-one game launcher was a fucking horrible idea, instead doubling down on making everything, at every turn possible, more convoluted with needless changes just to make sure that their commitment to being as fucking retarded as Bobby Cock-Tick is unmatched by any other company, which is pretty hard to do, given the past few years with all the competition to be the King of Stupid.

I hate that I had to return each and every Xmas gift I had bought for my nieces and nephews because I couldn't possibly have forseen this happening and that I'm not even sure if that will be enough to tide me through my bills until I get back to work. I hate that every time I have anything WHATSOEVER going for me, I'm given the metaphorical beatdown and made to feel ashamed of taking the slightest bit of pride in anything I do. I hate having to pretend everything is just fucking fine and dandy when I'm constantly at the mercy of MONEY controlling the overwhelming majority of what I can and cannot do.

I get to bed around 1:30 am, had to clean up the kitchen mess, left the dishes in the dishwasher, couldn't deal with them at the moment. I get into bed, have to be up around 10 because commissioner is to pick up their commission that I made. toss and turn, because every tiny little thing that I needed to do was on mind, finally get a sliver of sleep, alarm goes off. So, I get up and all fucking day. Not one peep from commissioner. I'm fucking pissed. My mom scolds me for not doing the dishes prior, which pisses me off even more. My mom then tells me to make peanut butter cookies, but I couldn't until my nephew's friend left, because he's allergic to peanuts. I didn't want to do it. I tried getting out of it, but she insisted, but of course, she had to make dinner first. I told her, I wasn't going to do it too late. I started at 7 and thanks to the people living with me, they were inside the kitchen and disrupting my progress every 10 seconds, so it took a lot longer. I got to bed at 4 am. My legs were about as strong as an arm flailing tube man and I scrape myself to bed, having to be up in 4 hours because my mom insisted that we shop at 8:30 am.

So I get up. I scrape myself around two stores and low and behold, have several non verbal run ins with an old woman shoving me aside in almost every isle and crashing her basket into mine, nearly tipping it a few times. I mean, at this point, I'm pretty damn sure she was just looking to pick a fight with someone from the way she turned and glared at me each time. I'm ragged, tired and I've absolutely had enough, so after the last time she shoved into me, I turn and said, ""Are you kidding me?!"" and she gives me a glare. I tell myself, ""I gotta get out of here before I lose it."" Oh, but the best part wasn't over yet. Little miss shove-and-glare just had to try and budge in front of me while at check out, inching little by little as the woman in front of me moved up. I looked over at her and said, ""No."" with the biggest scowl on my face that I could muster up. Now, I don't normally do this to people, but it was just the wrong day at the wrong time and I wasn't going to take shit from anyone. Luckily, she backed off and I went on my way.

So, I go home, go to nap. I need this. I wake up about 3 hours later, splitting headache, I can't even balance on my legs, let alone straighten them out properly as I stand. I get a text message from commissioner, asking if they could pick it up in half an hour. The half hour they wanted was already gone. So I text them, apologized and explained the situation. They say it's alright, ask if they can pick it up what was supposed to be an hour ago. You guessed it. They flaked and to put the cherry on top of this fantastic weekend, my mom told me to wait up for my dad who will be arriving here at 11:30 and to get my shoes on and help him bring in his luggage in the middle of a FUCKING SNOW STORM. Oh and before I went to lay down today, she had the fucking nerve to tell me that if I didn't want my legs to feel sore, that I needed to lose weight and you guessed it, she heard it from me.   


So with that said, fuck everything and anything to come, cause I'm absolutely fucking done. I did my end of the deal with my commission and instead of being grateful that I put my time into it when others are waiting for theirs, they decide not to be.   


And to those who genuinely believe that their time is more valuable than others AND/OR that they will be excused for rubbing their piss poor attitude onto others because it's the holidays, go on a fucking vacation, because you obviously need one.",1575350087.0,3

I went to my mum's house for thanksgiving dinner last night because my brother and his new wife were in town visiting.  Because they will not be around for christmas - we brought each other's gifts and opened them all together.  All pretty normal..  

Less than an hour after i arrived, i asked my sister if she had planned on ever giving me back the gamecube console i lent her 5-6 years ago while she was in medschool, along with the hundreds of dollars of games i had purchased for the system.  She replied by stating that it was never mine and it is HERS and even if it was mine, who cares because the games 'couldn't have been that expensive anyway'.  My face turned about as red as humanly possible.. i called her an asshole and a liar and went outside for a cigarette to calm down.  I didn't bring it up for the rest of the night and let it go (at least outwardly and as per my husband's instance).

After dinner we all watched a movie and played a board game.  I suggested going to a museum in the morning (science center, science museum or the art gallery). 

My cat woke me up VERY early the followimg morning and out of .. idk anger? Frustration? I caved and purchased myself the on sale ps4 system as well as the sega genesis mini.  More or less, figuring that these systems would make me feel slightly less pissed off about the night before... *note to self - don't make large purchases out of spite or anger*

I text and tried to call my mum multiple times between 7am and 9am unsuccessfully. Her home phone would ring once and then go straight to voicemail.  I text her asking her to call me back - saying that i thought her phone might be blocking my calls as spam or something. No response.. 

Around 3pm i call her again and she says they are at the museum. I reply with..  'uhhh... thanks for the invite?' To which she says 'well there wasnt enough room in the car for everyone.' 

I am in my mid 30s.  I constantly feel like i am stuck sitting at the fucking 'kids' table or i am ignored / looked at as being the liar when 99% of the time it is my younger sister who is.  I am so irritated by this and i am half tempted NOT to show up at christmas.  I am just as tempted to call my mum tomorrow and call her out on her bs and part in last night's fight since she immediately sided with my sister and told me to drop it. 

Anywho - i just REALLY needed to rant and i'm quite angry still even 24 hours after the fact.  I'm very torn on what my next step should be so advice is welcome.

826,e4psf8,I really wish I had a swimming pool (shitty title but read the post and you’ll get it),"Title is bad and everyone is probably gonna comment and be like “dude me too everyone wants one find something better to complain about” but listen here because it’s not just that

When I say I really wish I had a swimming pool it’s not for the reasons you think; such as cooling down on a hot summer day, having fun, chillaxing or throwing pool parties, no, if that was the reason why I’d just say “ah I wish I had a swimming pool”

No, here’s my reason: I have the crappiest back of all time. I’m not even 16, and yet I can barely stand for 9 minutes without being in a shit ton of pain. I can’t exercise or be active at all, so my muscles are turning into putty and I’m pretty sure I’m suffering from hypertension. And what helps with putty muscles and hypertension? Excercise, but I can’t bloody do that because my spine is a floppy cock. 

However there is one exercise I can do that won’t force me into bed for the next 7 hours, and what is that? Swimming. Full body exercise, easy to do, refreshing and relaxing.

What’s the problem now? Well I live in one of the coldest countries on earth so swimming for free is only available for about a month or two, and those months the beach is full with people and jellyfish are everywhere, and the rest of the bloody year I wouldn’t even make a single lap around the indoor pools without getting interrupted by some kid doing the cannonball landing on me

So I just wish I had my own swimming pool or something so I could exercise daily like a normal person and not have to stay in bed all day, sure there are probably clubs or programs or something for people who can’t exercise outside of the water but they’re probably far away and probably only meet up like once or twice a week for an hour and I don’t think that’s enough exercise for me

And on top of this, this summer I found out I can’t have gluten, and when I cut gluten out of my diet my stamina suddenly increased and I stopped feeling lethargic and now I have normal energy levels etc, and it’s just SO god damn frustrating to not be able to spend that energy just because my back was built by a toddlers building blocks

So I just wish I had a private pool so that I could exercise daily and whenever I wanted and just live a better life overall, but that’s about impossible",1575242723.0,4
827,e476da,Having issues porting a game on a 3ds and no one has offered help yet.,"For a few days now I have been trying to port DOOM (1993) onto my old 3DS XL, the sites I've found the ports on don't work, the video that I found one port on just does the same. So I thought ""well, why not ask the guy that clearly knows a bunch about homebrew (the program I'm trying to use) if he can help me?"", but that has failed just a few minutes before I started typing.

I am introduced to the verification screen, put in my phone number and then BAM I'm in. And then I noticed that there are no other channels, only ""welcome and rules"" and ""welcome-verification"", despite the fact that ALL OVER THE FUCKING SERVER it said there were MANY OTHER CHANNELS. So I asked my question, which is basically ""hey, I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm trying to port a game onto my 3DS and it isn't working"" just a yellow screen, no matter what I do when I open it ""the only thing that I can say is that the game used homebrew 11.6"" the most recent is 11.2 which supports: 11.9, 11.10, 11.11, basically almost anything but 11.6.

I am then greeted with a message by the server's bot saying that I was kicked for failing verification.

1 I already passed verification, how the fuck else was I able to comment in the first fucking place?

2 I wasn't given any other options, the only channel that showed up was the verification channel.

Another example of unions forcing me to work less efficiently. I don't like it.

For example our current process for vacation requests is I have to print out a form. Then I fill it out and give it to my supervisor. He approves it and then gives it to the clerk. The clerk then files the form in records and updates the calendar.

With office 365 I could create a form, then with power automate have that form automatically sent to the supervisor for approval. Then once approved have the form automatically saved in records and the calendar automatically updated. But it would essentially eliminate that aspect of her job, so can't do it.

A musical keyboard (microphone and headset as well as stand included, quite a deal tbh, at least where i live because everything is extremely expensive here) for around 87 dollars and a 3Ds video game because I miss playing Nintendo

Maybe that’s where it all came from, we used to not be able to afford anything, so from like age 8 I would just start making the cheapest wishes and repress Things i actually wanted

Have been working there almost 3 years, not fully as I am mostly like a seasonal worker. So much has changed since then.

 The 1st year was the most pleasant and I was really a good worker as we had really great boss, but he didn't see that there is growth in this work, so he quit, sadly. And that is when all the things were getting out of hand.

The 2nd year when I got back was crazy. I was always stabbed in the back as there where new employees which I didn't know yet, so got to deal with lot of bad comments and rumors around me. Like I am working poorly and always sitting on my phone. Got even accused of stealing some money from our safe, when it was gone missing....
Got only one co-worker who always said that there is a rumor about me again and was honest with me. She always got my back.

Now is the 3rd year I am working there. I was gone for a month and got back. Said they are now giving additional bonuses to your current pay. Like I get 4 eur/h and if I don't mess up I get 0,45 eur/h additionally. They also have 2 new employees. I was talking with one of them and it is like forbidden to talk about the pay, but we still were kind of curious, so now I got to know she gets paid 4,45 eur/h and if she doesn't mess up she gets additionally 5 eur/h

Like Are you serious?
Are you like taking me for a fool?

While I don't frown upon what you do with your Patreon, could you not act like you're better than everyone else? I just saw a FB post where a Patreon user was complaining how she doesn't like being touched and especially not in public and that her ""work"" and her life are separate things blah blah blah. Like, yeah, obviously no one should touch you if you don't want to. But maybe if someone recognizes you and is trying to get your attention, maybe don't act like a heartless bitch? Maybe just say hi and be on your way? I mean, your ""work"" is literally you acting like a whore asking people to pay to watch it.

Not all women are like this, but I just find it wierd how the modern world reacts to these kinds of stuff. When you do something as a man, it will be received more poorly than if you did it as a woman.

863,dvddu6,How Is National General Insurance Company Still In Business?,"I believe there is a total misunderstanding between insurance companies and policyholders. So you are telling me that if someone has insurance and they hit my vehicle.. that their insurance company is not obligated to cover the damages of my vehicle??  Isn't an insurance policy suppose to protect you as the driver, and assist with any damages that you may cause as a driver?? If not, then what are we actually paying all these thousands of dollars to these insurance companies for? I'm starting to realize that these insurance companies tend to feel like they are not obligated to pay out automobile claims, automobile claims under certain circumstances in which a policyholder does not have a contract with their company, even though their driver's policy includes property damage reserved for other vehicles that they may possibly get into an accident with. Whoever is reading this post as a policyholder, you all should seriously investigate the terms and conditions of your policies. It appears to me as if insurance companies are very crafty at avoiding paying towards their policyholders accidents via automobile claims. It should be illegal to sell auto insurance that doesn't, or will not cover the average cost of a bad accident. Which leads to the fact that, low coverage policies will not cover the average cost of a bad accident, whereas, the other driver's vehicle (the claimant) has been totaled. So therefore, if you have a low coverage policy then you should think twice about having an accident, because if you are sued by the other driver, your insurance company will only cover up to the amount that is included within your low coverage policy, exposing you (the client) to several other fees that you may not be able to afford due to being sued by the claimant. To avoid this unprofessional process, I'd highly recommend you AVOID low coverage policies altogether.",1573580616.0,2

I was satisfied with them for the first year that I used them, but the problems began around Jan 2012 and it's been a nightmare ever since.  Let's just examine what has happened in the last few months.  1.) The internet kept disconnecting each and every day for an entire month.  Mediacom made a ton of excuses, all of which were lies.  Sure enough, internet began working again normally after that.  2.) I found out that Port Forwarding no longer worked, even though it worked on the same modem router for many years with no problems.  Mediacom told me that while they have Port Forwarding on their website, they don't actually support the feature.  They told me that I should buy my own modem router.  3.) I bought my own modem router and installed it on Oct 26.  I mailed their modem router back to them on Nov 04 (eight days ago).  Now, not only are they trying to charge me the $11.50 for rental fees for the billing cycle of Nov 11 through Dec 10, but they are claiming that they have not received my modem router yet so they will continue to keep charging me rental fees.  I've always been so mad at them for many years where I wish someone would just blow up their facilities.  Now, if they think they are going to keep charging me rental fees for equipment I no longer have, I'm going to feel like personally murdering every one of them.  Of course I am not going to do that.

I can understand why people don't like abortion, it does involve taking a life, but if you leave it at that i'm fine with you existing at the same time as me. But goddamn it, pro lifers are very controlling, they try to guilt trip people by saying extreme shit, I even saw a sign that was like ""What? No conscious. Vote pro life"". 2 times in one thread I was told to not have sex, 1 I never said I didn't want a fucking child, 2 that's my problem whether I want to fuck a woman or not, 3 it just shows that they want to choose what people to with their bodies, they're trying to take away the option for women to do something that THEY deem necessary. Pro lifers think we're pro abortion and everybody just chooses to abort their unborn child because FUCK IT. Multiple times in one thread I've mentioned that abortion exists because people fuck up, some guys don't think through the safe sex route because their engines are already revving more than a stubborn mustang driver and that fuel needs to go somewhere, and sometimes the girl might even forget to take the pill. Abortion is not the main option, it's the last option when the rest are burned out. But pro lifers don't care, they just want to take away a choice because abortion is murder. I'm not saying it isn't, but they make it sound horrific. ""They rip the baby out and tear it apart and throw it in the garbage."" No they fucking don't, I'm not sure what they do after they abort, but they certainly don't just shove their hands into vaginas and rip and stomp on the egg until it's nothing but a mess on the floor to get swept up and thrown into a garbage can to get crushed by a truck and thrown into the dump. And pro lifers don't understand that not everybody is going to be up for adopting a child, plus it isn't that simple, pro lifers think everybody should follow these rules: ""Don't fuck, but if you do and don't want to be a parent just hand your child to a fucking stranger"". PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO FUCKING DO THAT! Why would a woman, who according to the pro lifers I argued with, ""a woman who isn't strong because she avoids a responsibility"", go through the 9 months of growing a baby, then deal with the worst pain in the world, just hand her baby away?  And that baby will grow up to realize that they only exist because some careless people wanted to fuck, but didn't want to keep their child because they were and accident. Why would pro lifers want people to grow up to realize their parents made them as an accident? Oh I know, because they can't just handle that fact that this world fucking sucks, is over populated, and no one wants to be alive, and they guilt trip and shame and berate anybody that didn't want to give birth to a mistake.

876,dsv3pn,Always seeking help on this one.,"Well I am  actually male ,and I can feel sick if some other male and so many males touch their own genitals in front of me ( what kind of a sick gesture is this!).

I am wondering if the world has deteriorated so bad to the extent people can suddenly gang-up on one person NOT thru street gang method but thru a more classy way like USING A SOCIAL NETWORK AND CAN LAST FOR A FEW YEARS- JUST TO HARASS SOMEONE?

Don't know what happened in the first place but may be it  went to start with an ex-collegue in the Information Technology industry , in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia who seemed to like to touch his own genitals (a Malay guy by race) in front of me.That was between years 1997-1999 , when I was having a job there.

In 1999, I went back to my hometown Penang, Malaysia and needed a career holiday because I  really fell sick and took an almost one year break before continuing to find work both in KL and Penang - and I landed a job in a retail outlet and I thought I cannot find a sick colleague ever again but suddenly this Chinese supervisor seemed to like to do those touching the dick acts again, just like that Malay person in KL. After 1 and a half years, I switched to a new retail outlet and this time the Retail Manager does those same sick gestures again - after home there were a few other people and I think this has been too much of a coincidence not to overreact.

Now I am at another retail company called Umay Hometex at Bukit Mertajam Penang and the Sales Manager himself finds the opportunity to practice the same gestures when he visits ( on this paragraph I am putting names just to tell people I am not easily scared off and will name these people in official reports).

I am always thinking of damaging their private parts because after they have been SO DAMN RUDE and if working in retail is concerned, staff are being penalised with pay cuts for offences even by shoplifters during their duty hours, for instance.

I am also wondering about the way social networking works these days.  Speaking from my own experience, you can be left out by your own graduating class whether in school or college these days by being refused connection ,which means you can be a good sitting duck if your own family are not too influential or your own family kind of sucks when you are in trouble due to your friends. You can have influential relations but your own immediate family can be not that lucky if it is having too much internal problems ,even though there have been no loud arguments.

My sister wants him crate trained so whenever he’s asleep we move him to the crate to make him get used to it. He always cries whenever he’s in there. Today while she was at the shower my annoying ass loud mom thought it was a good idea to wake him after he finally calmed down so he kept on crying. I decided to move him from his crate to his playpen to make him stop crying.

891,dqcft8,I hate Half-Life 2.,"Someone needs to create a guide on how not to puke when playing Half-Life 2.  I loved the first game.  It's one of my most favorite games ever, despite being over 20 years old.  On a scale from 1-100, Half-Life 1 was definitely 90-100.  But Half-Life 2 is like a 0-10.  I played Half-Life 2 around 1.5 years ago and I completed the first nine chapters.  I remember feeling like puking back then too.  And every chapter was so boring.  I hated the game.  But I know how my feelings about things can change over time.  Sometimes some things that I didn't initially like, I ended up liking later.  So the reason I didn't complete the game 1.5 years ago was because it sucked but also because my laptop died.  When I copied my game files over, for some reason it lost my save files.  So I'm starting the game over from the beginning.  I just completed the first three chapters.  The boat ride chapter is the one that makes me want to puke.  Thankfully, I finally finished that chapter, but I still feel nauseous hours later.  I went on YouTube to remind myself what the next six chapters will be like and I'm not looking forward to it.  They all sucked.  Each chapter takes a long time to complete.  And even after I've completed those six chapters, I will still have four end chapters that I haven't played yet.  I'm punishing myself playing this shitty game, just so I can get 100% Steam achievements and say that I played it.  But I absolutely hate it.  I mean, I guess that I respect the fact that it has driveable land and water vehicles, but I don't care about that.  As a shooter where I'm shooting mostly humans, it has a good game engine, but honestly I'd rather play a shooter like F.E.A.R. because that game is more enjoyable and immersive.  Nothing about this sequel makes me feel like I am in the Half-Life universe.  The first game was amazing.  There was a huge equipment failure.  Then breaches from one world into another.  Aliens taking over the facility and hijacking humans and turning them into zombie mutants.  The aliens also changed our environment.  And there were so many different types of aliens too, from small to big.  It really felt like Hell was taking over Earth.  But in the sequel, the characters and dialogue are extremely crappy.  No one treats Gordon Freeman like he should be treated.  The man in gray acts like a goddamn GPS navigation instead of some mysterious deity.  The aliens have little no impact on our planet.  And it's mostly a stupid Sci-Fi game with a totalitarian government and futuristic machines.  Rant over.  I own Episodes 1 and 2, but I probably will never play them.  Fuck this game.  And if Half-Life 3 ever ends up like Half-Life 2, fuck that game too.  I wish that Half-Life 2 never came out and they just used that Source engine to create a non Half-Life game as an engine demo.",1572651682.0,1

And because my classmates don't give a shit about their work, they decide to play along with his game and do the assignment for homework. Boycott the bastard or whatever, you're literally doing an assignment about the history of boycotts, I dunno how the boycott would even go, or if a boycott is even possible, but quit encouraging him!!

The bastard even plays guitar in the middle of class! How are we supposed to focus when you're plucking the same notes over and over instead of playing chords like a REAL MAN?

Sometimes times I worry about people and another I dont care about them, because of feelings of social injustice. I dont speak with my parents very often, my mother doesn't want to listen to my ideas neither does my father, my sister thinks I dont love our family. I dont have girlfriend, all my life I was surrounded by women with daddy issues,im 23 but look 14 ,women dont take me seriously from romantic perspective,they say I could be their brother, besides the fact that most of them are 4 years younger than me, 4 years keep that in mind, let that sink in, if I have chance with women sometimes I because they are horny for sex and only sex witch I dont find very appealing as im in search in recent for a long term partner. Besides them most people dont take my presence seriously as I look less experienced with life because of my baby looks,employers dont think I have what it takes to work. Friends form my teens say that I have changed and that hanging out with me feels strange to them. I have a chronic porn addiction, I feel like im cursed and that invisible powers do exist, because bees only sting me, dogs only attack me, cats run away from,i aways end up in street fights with other people whatever i go out,im not aggressive person,but my behavior is pretty chaotic and clumsy and it seems to confuse some of the people thinking that im about to hit someone, or that im acting like a tough guy but actually im trying to be funny to make people laugh,but all it ends up is making people suffer around me, and most annoying thing is that all of my peaceful days are when im all alone.

899,dp6m1n,Musicians who refuse to learn difficult music,"I have had to ask twelve pianists to play for a gig next Tuesday. Eleven of them declined because even though the VAST FUCKING MAJORITY OF THE FUCKING SONG is easy as fuck chords for them, there is a solo of 24 beats of 90bpm (16 seconds) that's a bit fiddly and syncopated. My part is RIDICULOUSLY SYNCOPATED and I learnt it in an afternoon.

When I finally got my twelfth pianist who agreed, he mocked the first eleven because (his words) they are all fucking fairies.

Even though my twelfth pianist is roughly as good as the other eleven, he is the only one I respect now because he's the only one who doesn't defenestrate his musicianship when it stops being cruisy. It turns out that the vast majority of good music isn't exactly a breeze to play. 

#thats like the whole fucking reason why people find impressive musicians impressive

So unless:

• You're getting married next week
• You break your coccyx 
• You're a complete noob

900,doz62n,EA and Yahoo both suck,"So a couple months ago I realized that the yahoo account I made when I was 11 had been compromised. They changed the verification so I couldn’t get it back without “yahoo paid customer service” so i figured since the only thing I care about on that email is that my origin account is attached to it, i would just try to switch it over. 8-9 cases later, still no resolution. I called them twice, made the same complaints and told them that somebody was going to take my origin account. Still nothing until tonight when it happened. You can imagine how livid I was after over 5000 hours of game play just vanished along with my favorite games. So after looking their 3 hour wait period in the eye, i figured it might be worth the 5 dollars that yahoo is charging me to get my account back. So i call them and this lady picks up and she helps me get my account back and after everything she asks for my card information. The way she says it made me uncomfortable so i asked what exactly im paying for since i got my account back. She says its so that it saves my password and so i can send and receive emails and its just so unconvincing.  To top it off she asked me to sign a terms and services which waves a class action lawsuit against their third party customer service. So its like red flags all over for me and im receiving emails in the mean time so she gives up and hangs up the call.

I feel deep down his parents don't trust me to hang out in my boyfriend's they think I'll end up having sex with him in his room. I won't do that because we both promised each other we'll have sex after marriage because we're both Christian and we both made a promise to God that we will not have sex until after marriage. So I kinda hate going to his house because it can't be just the two of us at his house. The only place it can be the two of us when I'm over at his house is on the porch. We can't always hang out on the porch. I'm only allowed to hang out in his room when we're married. I can't wait that long. I wish the western world would change this stupid social rule of not letting boyfriends and girlfriends into each other's rooms. Why does the western world have this stupid rule?

So I have an 83% in AP Bio right?? Problematic I know. I have a test on Wednesday so she comes upstairs fuming and goes “why aren’t you studying???” And This isn’t an irregular scene where I’m on fucking task and doing the stuff I actually am supposed to do (I’m not even sure WHY she constantly thinks I’m not doing what I’m supposed to be doing? I’m typically a straight-A student, and currently I’m getting all of my grades up since I have an 88 in algebra and a 84 in honors English) and I reply “ok why do you never get context clues. I’m currently discussing TKAM with (brother’s name) and have other homework that needs to be done first. Please stop just barging up here and accusing me.” And her fucking reply. IS DONT SPEAK TO ME IN THAT TONE OF VOICE. Is it impossible for parents to like... apologize??? I don’t mean to sound entitled but to be freakin fair, I don’t think I was being snappy. Any fucking time I point out what my parents are doing wrong I either get “don’t speak to me like that” “well you should be thankful I don’t (x/y/z)” “I’m not doing anything wrong” and I’m so done with it. I mean I can’t ask for basic respect to be followed (I use non-binary pronouns but they don’t want to because, and I quote, “it’s too much work I don’t want to have to think so hard whenever I talk about you”) but nOooooo me getting frustrated in your unfounded mistrust is SO disrespectful.

I work at a hotel, I work over nights. There is a girl about my own age who works with me, she’s deeply disturbed, depressed, and suicidal. She use to talk to me about all her problems and I made the mistake of not drawing a line and basically became her shoulder to cry on.  Well last week, I got a text from her saying she was cutting herself, I texted her first telling her I wasn’t feeling well and the next text I received from her was her self harming text. I asked if she was okay, she immediately said yeah and changed the subject asking if my stomach was still bothering me (just found out I’m pregnant) anyways lost in confusion I told her I wasn’t decided if I was coming in or if I was going to go to the e.r since I had been nauseous for over a week at this point and unable to eat. Her immediate response is I’m going to kill myself right now. So I called the suicide hotline and they told me exactly what to do, so I called the police. They did a wellness check. I immediately get bombarded with hateful messages (non threatening) but pure rage and hate saying I’m malicious, and evil. I never responded to those messages because I didn’t want to get angry and say things I can’t take back or  cause anymore problems. So I left it alone, I told my managers at my job what he transpired, while I understand that it shouldn’t have been brought into the work place it was inevitable because we work together.  Fast forward to an awkward week, we come to last night. She wants to talk about what happened, so I let her talk, now this becomes quickly a one sided conversation where I am being called dramatic and untrustworthy. Because she feels a type of way about police. The entire conversation went on about how she can’t trust me anymore, I’m dramatic. Apparently she’s been discussing the issue with other coworkers, her father (who worked at a suicide prevention hotline) and her father told her how I handled it wrong, right now I’m at a point where I don’t see how he can be concerned about how I handled things and not concerned about his daughter telling people she’s gonna kill herself. I feel like lies and manipulative things are being said about me. So I’m just stressed and trying to move in with my life, I would consider leaving but my husband and I are trying to buy a house.  She’s told me she doesn’t see my side of things and doesn’t see how she’s wrong. I’m the one who caused all this I’m the one being shunned and put down and feeling like shit.

A few days ago, two of my friendship groups made a group chat together (me included), and they got along really quickly which I was happy about. But now they're getting along almost too well and I'm beginning to feel left behind despite the fact that I knew most of them individually before they all knew each other. I'm trying not to think about it but it's seriously getting to me.
But wait, there's more...
Two of those friends I've known for a very long time separately. They were like my best friends. Let's call one of them Amy and the other Isaac. Recently they met each other and I was so happy they got along. But then it accelerated. I noticed isaac and Amy were messaging each other pretty much every day, which me and Amy never did (I was closer to Amy then I was to Isaac). Here's the annoying part. Amy is gay and Isaac is bi, but recently they've been pretendin that they're married and stuff. They included me by calling me their son but that made it worse. They've literally left me behind. And what's worse is that Amy is usually the one I talk to about every problem I have, and she's always great at talking me out of it and helping me. But I can't talk to her about this.
Not many people know I had mental health issues. I kept them repressed all throughout lower school and kept smiling and pretending everything was ok. I had to, I was the optimistic person that lifted everyone's spirits. But now I'm feeling that repression more than ever. And I can't talk about it to anyone except to people I don't know.

913,dms1tz,I'm.. just tired.,"I'm tired of school, people, and a lot. Not in the..  depressed cut yourself way, but I'm really just tired of everyone and everything. I know others have it worse, but life sucks! For whoever is reading this I'll explain why I am so tired. My apologies if there's Grammer mistakes and stuff, I'm not really prioritizing spelling and crap. (Expect commas in weird spots)

First off, while I'm insanely happy to be able to see again, my new glasses are driving me insane. They're great and all, but they make me.. lightheaded? All I know is that it really bothers me. Compared to other crap I'm gonna complain about, this is definitely the least of my problems. Second of all, there's a fire about an hour from me. While I'm aware the fire is an hour away, we'll still get hit with smoke, and I feel really bad for the people who live over there. Hopefully nobody gets hurt. Along with this fire, pg&e might turn off the power this weekend. That's just great! Its almost if they don't want us to have food. I'd care less for it if we weren't poor. Yes I'm aware I have a phone, I go to school, and stuff but we can barley afford food. Probably only have 10 dollars to last all of next week, and we live In an area where everything is so damn expensive. There is dollar tree, but that's 15 minutes away... Then again so is everything else. If it wasn't for school I would probably not be eating breakfast or lunch, but that comes with it's own flaws. Their food is weird. The soups taste kinda like nothing, and their Mac and cheese has powder..? I really shouldn't be complaining about that though, I am really fortunate to even get free school lunch and breakfast. The thing I hate the most about school is the fact that the students are TERRIBLE. Someone set one of the classroom's floors on FIRE yesterday! We've had multiple bomb threats, people hate me, and everyone is so disrespectful. I heard my favorite teacher was crying after my class once. She's literally the best, and she gets barley any respect. Nobody will shut up, and I'm just so tired of all of it! I feel like my own friends are getting tired of me, and I really don't know what to do with my life. I get excited over practically nothing. Even if someone plays volleyball or some crap I'm smiling like I just got a gift. Probably because people don't respect each other. Two years ago someone always said ""ew"" when she walked past me, but she's stopped now since I hardly reacted to it.  Really, what's the point of reacting when nobody cares of your feelings. This is why the internet is so nice. You guys seem to insult people less, but then again there are those certain people. Without it, though I'd feel like a complete outcast, useless, and genuinely, I'd feel like a piece of actual trash. 

I'm so sorry for whoever has it worse, and I'm sorry for complaining. I know I really rambled on for a bit, but I just have a lot to complain about at the moment. I used to be such an optimistic kid, but now I'm such a pessimist. Thank you for listening, and again I'm sorry. I hope if something bad is happening in your life, it gets better.

So I politely ask him to move since I was just sitting there not even 2 minutes ago, and he says “nope I found it first”. And so I proceed to tell him that this is literally the seat I was just sitting in not even 2 minutes ago, so I give him a little shove to just tell him to get up. He gets up and sits on the floor next to me and I know that we’re pals, I toss him a piece of paper that says “roses are red, quiet as a mouse, your door is unlocked, I’m inside your house” as just a joke because we’re friends. He doesn’t do anything but he doesn’t do anything for the first bit and then he throws it back at me, nothing in the note has changed and far as I know. And I wait a bit and then I put the note down his shirt because I think were just messing around, but I’m wrong, he absolutely looses it he swipes my expensive ass laptop onto the hard floor (there was no damage but still tho) as well with all my other books and junk but I don’t really care about that. And he just starts SLAMMING on the table, and so at this point I’m confused but this is just one thing that happened in that class. About five minutes go by and my other friend comes back to the seat and she thought that I was sitting on her book but I tell her that I in fact did not sit on her book, so she continues to yell at me and so I just tell her to shut the fuck up, ( and this is about the point where I am so unbelievably pissed) she pushes me into the fucking ground. At this point I say “what the fuck, why do you do shit like this all the time, your being a fucking bitch”. And she makes this stupid ass face at me and she’s like “*gasp I can’t believe you would say that?” And at this point I’m surrounded by the entire class telling me that I can’t swear at girls. And so I try to justify myself saying all the shit that she has done to me in the past, but that doesn’t work.

I'm 17, Graduated, Jobless. It's been a long year. Almost lost my mom to suicide. Thankfully she was able to get to a hospital and is fine now many months later. The difficult thing? Her boyfriend. The man who told her to go ahead and kill herself the night she attempted. Ever since it's been constant arguing between them. Many times he's threaten to move out, or she tells him he needs to go. But he's still here. (Quick information about him. He's still legally married to his ""ex"". Refuses to give her the devorce papers.) Lately it's been a struggle. 

I sit at home all day, in charge of dinner the nights my mom works. I have 3 younger siblings. 2 are gone at their biological dad's how during the week days but it's still exhausting to have to take care of food and keeping the house clean. Her boyfriend works 4 days a week. When he is home I'll try to get him to take me out. just so I can get out of the house for a bit.  Usually to my mom's work, she's a nurse his aunt is in the long term facility she works at. His response? ""It's your fault you don't ever leave the house. Take the tracks or bus."" Knowing I don't have money. Still, I'll remind him it costs money I don't have. He just tells me to get a job like I haven't been trying. It's stupid but this really is affecting me emotionally.

939,dibmhr,Fuck Mediacom.,"I had this same modem and router combo since 2012-2013.  During all of the time from then until now, I was able to port forward any port for any game.  This allowed me to host a server and have other players join my game.  I didn't even bother with dedicated servers, I just created simple listen servers.  Then my laptop broke and I had to replace it.  When I replaced my laptop, I deleted all of my port forward settings because I wanted to tidy things up a bit and I was no longer playing those games.  But after a year, I decided to play them again and I discover I can't port forward.  I tried everything that I could think of, and finally contacted Mediacom support.  They told me ""Unfortunately, while we offer port forwarding in our settings, we do not support the feature.  This is normally used to bypass the security NAT settings to improve game performance.""  I went off on them and then they replied ""We do have the option to set up port forwarding to enhance game play but do not actually support this feature.  In an effort to resolve problems you might be experiencing, you can factory reset the modem.""  Well, I tried doing a modem factory reset but nothing happened.  It just disconnected me from the internet for a couple of minutes and then connected me again.  Port forwarding still doesn't work.  I went to a website and tested all common ports and every single one of them was closed.  This isn't natural.  It isn't right.  And it sure in hell isn't acceptable.  But I haven't replied to them because I know I'll get nowhere.  This is after nine years of shit internet, extremely outrageous prices, and the worst experiences.  AT&T probably costs half as much, they wouldn't charge monthly rental fees for equipment, they would give 2-3x as much internet data, and their internet is a billion times more reliable.

945,dhr15x,Still annoyed,"So earlier this year for Valentine’s Day, I decided to get my girlfriend 2 gifts. One drawing of her favorite animal and the other of her favorite singer. Panda drawing turned out great. Came after Valentine’s Day (I think I bought her a 3rd gift so I don’t look like an ass) but it was fine since I loved how it turned out and the artist was super sweet. The singer drawing however.... was a messy process with the artist since the beginning. The artist didn’t start my drawing until a week after I paid her (drawing was $50 🙃) and Valentine’s Day was only 2 weeks away. So I had to tell my girlfriend she’s getting that gift late. The artist failed to tell me that the post office near her town is unreliable so it would take me 3 months to get the drawing (we both live in the US) until I confronted her about the wait. The drawing came in the mail super wrinkled up with no protection so I got pissed. She refused to give me my money back after 3-4 months of waiting for the drawing to show up. She lacks communication and is the reason why I have trust issues with artists (I know not all artists are unreliable, I’ve had great experiences with some, she just turned out to be the bad apple that ruined it for me) so I now prefer to do invoices on PayPal instead of paying it in full. I never ended up giving my girlfriend that drawing and it didn’t even end up that good. I’m kinda over it, but just thinking about this makes me so fucking mad at how I wasted my time and money on her. Thank you if you read this long stupid rant.

Edit: she has apologized about the wait, I forgave her for it but I found it super ridiculous how I had to confront to her about it in order for her to tell me about the post office issue months after I submitted the commission.

952,dga2fb,I’m documenting the events of a roommate slash tenant situation,"Warning: this post is really long and it’s mostly for myself.

Playing landlord sucks. So I have a 2 BR condo and was gonna rent out my spare bedroom to a friend of a friend starting early this year aka we would be roommates. However, I got a new job so I moved out but I told her she could stay - basically she got the whole condo to herself now for half the rent, you’re welcome. Even weeks before she moved in, packages started arriving for her containing all these boujie af furniture for the place. She plugged in this air freshener that reminds me of when in Mean Girls Janice said “you smell like a baby prostitute.” Anyways I told her from the start that I would still be in and out once a month or so because of events, until I find someone else to fill the 2nd room. I said this when her parents were here helping her move in so that they would know too. Every time I came back I would see something new and something else of mine stuffed in the linen closet. I mean that’s fine, she likes to make her space her own, nothing wrong with that. 

Also I’ve already missed out on multiple opportunities to fill the 2nd room bc of her, mainly because they’re boys so it’s totally understandable and I don’t want her to be uncomfortable. Even my old coworker who wanted to live in the condo looked her up in our work system and was like “yeah... She looks like someone I wouldn’t be able to stand.” At this point it’s almost not worth it... 

This is about when I’m going back this weekend. Every time before I’ve been letting her know at least a week or so before that I would be back except for this past 2 weekends. First bc it was literally last minute and unplanned and then the second was bc I was just so busy this week I forgot to remind her, but I did tell her that first weekend so she must have forgotten? But this is what she said:

“Hi! No problem! Thanks for letting me know! I have wanted to bring something up though. I feel that as a tenant there are really no boundaries or privacy. I'm totally fine with you coming back given the circumstances, but its not really like you're the roommate in the other room if that makes sense.  Do you think in the future you can let me know when you're coming back way more in advance instead of the day of? It's just very sporadic. I'm traveling some upcoming weekends so if you text me the day of I won't know before I leave. Especially if people are going to be stopping by, I think it's only respectful for me to know as a tenant.”

Umm girl like please check your privilege. How would things have been different if I were actually living there? Wouldn’t she be having LESS privacy than she does now? Also she pays only half the rent so technically I’m still “occupying” the other room. So I tell her something along those lines and she texts back:

“I take offense that you felt the need to remind me that I pay for half the rent. That was unnecessary. I’m sorry I even addressed my concern to you. All I’m asking is for some courtesy. I think considering all of the last-minute changes you’ve thrown at me without advance notice, I’ve adjusted quite well. You also did move out your belongings so that makes it feel like you're not really the roommate for the other room. You're not there regularly. In the interest of us both, let’s try to make this work. See you soon. 😊”

What. A. Psycho. Also, a passive aggressive smiley. What exactly is she offended by? That I reminded her of her privilege? Last minute changes aka when she got a whole condo to herself? Or when I finally got a friend to help me move out my old ass tv so her parents could order her a smart TV like she wanted? What an inconvenience. She’s a fellow at a pharma company nearby and any other fellow would kill to be in her position, because can we take a survey of how much the fellows pay per square footage to live here? But that doesn’t matter, she makes her parents pay for everything anyway. 

I’m terrified now that she will kill me in my sleep in my condo. TBD on if I remain alive this weekend.

-
I am still alive and still documenting lol. Because she tends to play victim and twists my words around I am no longer comfortable with a verbal agreement and would want everything in writing moving forward. However...

Her “I discussed the situation with my parents and they are as perplexed as I am about your sudden urge for me to “sign a lease.”  Currently we have a verbal month-to-month agreement. A verbal and written agreement is the same. (Umm no it’s not) I don’t believe it’s necessary for us to put anything further in writing other than come to terms on who moves in the other bedroom, currently being occupied by you. Thus far we have agreed on all of the terms, I have made multiple concessions to help accommodate both of our situations, I have paid rent in a timely manner. I’ve maintained a clean apartment and have given you no reason to be concerned of my tenancy. I’ve given you my word of my occupancy intent, and agree to give you no less than one month’s notice should I decide to vacate (which is not my intentions). I don’t occupy, nor will I or any of my future guests occupy the second bedroom or bathroom. I know my boundaries. Again, all I asked for is common courtesy when you intend on being there so that I can extend to you the same common courtesy and make sure I don’t leave my personal items strewed about, or have plans to have guests over at the same time. It’s that simple. We both have demanding schedules and should be putting our time and efforts into more productive things, such as our careers. To that end, I would prefer to keep the verbal month-to-month agreement as is until May and continue to discuss any other potential tenant for the second bedroom.”

Me “Thanks for discussing with your parents so quickly! I agree that a verbal agreement would be easier however it seems that we have had a few misunderstandings when things were communicated verbally (ie, my visits, the TV) so I would prefer to have everything in writing from now for both of our mutual understanding. I was wondering, would it be easier for you to rent the whole condo for 6 months? It seems that your parents were also considering getting a whole place for you and obviously it would be a good deal for you for the neighborhood, especially since you only have half a year to go, it would average much less than market price. And it would give you more privacy, and flexibility in finding someone that you want to live with instead of worrying about my placement of a stranger.”

Her “Thanks! I agree that we have had misunderstanding.  However, the misunderstandings that we have had do not warrant a lease agreement, they’re simply just things that I would prefer to be communicated in a more timely fashion. (as I have been doing but... still doesn’t work) My parents and I do not feel comfortable with me signing a lease until we know who the other roommate will be. Especially since the intent is to sublet the other room. For now, I will agree to lease month to month until a roommate is found. Once that is determined I will be comfortable to move forward with something in writing. If we cannot come to an agreement on terms with month to month until there's a roommate, then I will need some time to discuss further with my parents and weigh all of my options before agreeing to anything in writing. Honestly it was never my intentions to rent a two bedroom. I think you know how bad the fellowship salaries are. Which is why I was looking for a roommate. If I was in a different financial situation  to pay for what you would be asking then that would definitely be an option. (This is a lie bc I’ve been a fellow and she also told me this weekend what other fellows are paying, it’s totally doable... maybe cut back on the boujie lifestyle?) I also don't use the second bedroom (this is also a lie bc she threw her new TV box in there) and I have no issue having a roommate. I just don't feel comfortable not knowing who I will live with. And I think if you were in the same situation you would feel the same way. My roommate essentially left and there's a lot of uncertainty about who I will live with and for me to be coerced into signing a binding agreement where an unknown person is coming, just does not make sense to me when I've been nothing but a great tenant and roommate throughout this entire housing situation.”

Me “I'm sorry that this situation is overwhelming and I am trying my best to think of a solution that would benefit both of us. Every potential 2nd person I've first vetted with you before going further in the process and will continue to do the same. Could you please explain exactly what you mean by your preference of having a month to month lease until a roommate is found?”

At this point she has no answer to this question
 
Her “I just don't feel comfortable signing a lease without a roommate in place. I'm going to be home in a few weeks so I can discuss it further with my parents then but I definitely need time to think about all options.”

Me “I understand your concern and I'll have documents ready for your parents to review. You know it’s always been the intention to sublet whether it'd be rotation students or other employees etc and it's in both of our best interest to have everything in writing moving forward.”

The two that women name themselves after, have pictures and posters of, dress up as, inspire to be like, etc.  Those two are Marilyn Monroe and Harley Quinn.  It's pathetic.  Both sluts.  Both full of themselves.  One a psycho criminal and killer.  That's women for you.  They don't really hold any ideals.  They make a show of being virtuous and correct, always moaning about some inequality or injustice.  Really they are self serving, just creating a self image, trying to be picture perfect.

What's that? You didn't get the Bucket Hat, Classic Raccoon Mountain Hat, Liberty Hat, Newsboy Flat Cap or Sun Hat despite there being no warning of their misable or unique status?

You missed the unique Worn Flat Cap & John's Gambler Hat because at no point do you need to take the hats off & pick them up again so they're saved.

You missed the unique Scout Jacket from Pearson or the Vaquero Rider Spurs from Dutch? Well fuck you, do all the little things even though the others don't give you anything unique.

Didn't do that mission for Rain Falls the way we wanted you to do it? Well fuck you then, you don't get the Owl Feather Trinket. What do you mean we didn't worn you? You should've just done it the way we wanted you to.

Missed the Carolina Parakeet? How'd you do that? Why didn't you get them? Got out of Guarma fast? Well fuck you then. Guess you're not getting the, Scarlet Macaw, Blue and Yellow Macaw, Great Green Macaw, Red-Footed Booby, Red-Tailed Boa Snake, Rainbow Boa Snake or the Sunglow Boa Snake.

Missed some tiny little detail we neglected to mention? Well fuck you player, guess you'll just not be getting Jack's Drawing, the Antique Watch, Golden Shield or the Electric Chair Blueprint.

Going for all the trophies/achievements? Better not miss Friends With Benefits, Give to the Poor, Errand Boy & Lending a Hand. What's that? You did? Well restart then moron.

There's also a shit load of letters that are interesting but if you don't pick them up right away then fuck you we'll never let you have them. Didn't loot that poor old man who falls asleep in your camp? Well fine then, I'll just keep this Native American Ring.

I came in for minor repairs and tire changes, oil change ect. However the day I left my check engine light came on. I spent about 3000 dollars this day. I called the repair technician and he informed me it was an error and that he would clear it. I returned he cleared it, it was gone, only to return a day later. I could not continue to make trips to the dealership I have to work as well. SO I had to go through my week with my check engine light on causing me great nervousness and paranoia of my wife and children driving our car and suddenly being in an accident because the car has malfunctioned while driving. however when Icalled the repairman he ASSURED me that it was a computer glicth of some sort and it was nothing to worry about. He constantly informed me that if it was an error with ANY OTHER PART on my vehical the auto diagnostic would have caught it when i brought it in for service. i felt at ease only to be shocked when the very next day my vehical began to sputter, rattle, and jerk as if the power steering had went out and the rattleing sounded as if someone had left loose nuts and bolts inside of a vacuum. what is worse you might ask? it was a day that my wife needed the car to run errands. after caling and complaining to the repairman who, might i add, didnt answer my calls for an entire 3 days, they sent a tow truck to retrieve my vehical. after speaking with another representative i was told that the ""NEW"" repairs would amount to almost another $3,000. i am furious and what is worse I purchased my vehical from them! i was treated as if i was not a loyal customer and Iknow that i have been swindled out of my money.

He snores really loudly and often I am constantly tapping him and he will wake up slightly surprised, I'll tell him he was snoring, and he never has any idea he even fell asleep.

At first it wasn't an issue.  My friends and I mostly found it funny and sometimes the TV was background noise while we talked or messed around on our phones.  He would usually start a movie and fall asleep ten minutes in and I would just change it if I wanted to watch something different.  But lately it's getting to me.  We were both interested in getting through Neon Genesis Evangelion since it was on Netflix and started binging the episodes together.  But he loves to chain smoke blunts and will fall asleep for whole episodes.  At first I didn't mind rewatching ones he was out for but then I got sick of it and just kept watching while he was asleep.  At this point I'm basically watching in bed on my laptop and he watches several episodes behind me in the living room.  It's getting to the point where I don't want to be out in the living room with him and that's what troubles me the most.  The loud snoring doesn't help much either.",1570331052.0,6

Favouritism and racism is rampant. A bunch of shit students run around like they own the place all they have to do is suck up to the lecturers and they get away with it.

About to be done with this shit place only to be met by an even shittier family.

My father is a poor excuse of a person. I'm lucky that that ass spent most of his time working overseas I got to be in more control of my life.

He is the type of a shit person who uses blackmain as a powerplay. For everything he gives there is a three-fold return in the guilt-trip you recieve.

Same goes for my mom, but in her case what she does mostly is gossip to her sisters and the bullshit comes via that channel. Thus her ""loving mother"" status is upheld.

A handful of my cousins are backstabbing narcissistic shits who play instigator at rubbing salt in one's wound and another handful are a bunch of bimbos would go along just for shits and giggles.

This has been my life for the past 6 or so years. Just another shitty end to a shitty year.

My biggest regret is not gwtting a job as far away as I can. The thought of being stuck in my hometown with them, being dependent on them just fills me with loathing.

990,da8qbu,I can’t catch a break. And I really need to 😭,"Over the past year a lot of crazy shit has happened to me. A year ago I was temporarily staying with my father after my roommate and her fiancé decided to not tell me that their lease was going to be up in a couple weeks and they had just decided to not renew it because her fiancés parents said they could move in with them and all his other grown ass siblings( they are all over 30 except for the fiancés sister who was in her mid twenty’s). So i has recently started dating the guy that is still my current boyfriend, and I just sprung it on him if he would want to get a place with me because I can’t afford anywhere on my own and I also have gotten screwed in life previous to this so I still don’t have my drivers license, and he has a car and one of those thankfully( side note: I’ve tried to get my license 4 times and every car I’ve had to use has broken or gotten damaged before I can take the test, and yes I know you can rent a car from them, but I can’t afford another $275 on top of the $175 to take the test)and thankfully he said yes to us trying to find a place but with only two weeks we didn’t find anything so I begged my father to try and let me stay at his house for a little while again(side note: I’m only 21, I haven’t lived with him since I was 16 be his wife likes to beat on me and he doesn’t want to bother with divorce so he just got rid of me instead, cheaper than divorce to just get rid of your 16 year old child), so I really did do my best to not cause any stress in the house hold I was gone all day at work and would spend my days off with my boyfriend, yet she still threw me into a closet and then a door frame while I was trying to just put the front door so she could hurt me, this was 3 in the morning and I still don’t know what set her off, I told her goodnight and she raged out(welcome to my whole childhood). So after that happened we tried to stay with his mother and her at the time boyfriend, and it was going okay for like two weeks, then his mother started fighting with him about everything and we had to stay in the living room on the futon because the other room in the apartment was for the 4 cats, so when they did fight there was nowhere for a to go but to go on a drive which in the end has killed the suspension on his car. So this whole living with them lasted about 2 months almost 3 if you want to count up a few days. One day while I was at work I got a call from the bf on the work phone quite panicked, his mother was kicking us out days after the new year. I had been close to my then boss who had offered after she kicked out her baby daddy (because he had beat her and mistreated their 3 year old on New Year’s Eve)that we could move into her basement that she normally rented out to people. We were happy to have somewhere to go that we believed could be a new start. Boy was it the opposite of a new start more like a cliff you catch on  as you’re falling down a very steep mountain. Everything was great for like 2 months, our other coworker moved into another portion of the house and we were all happy and got along and had a great time. Then one day the baby daddy tried to break in to get some of his things back and she offered that if he set up a time then they could arrange him getting the rest of his things, well he came over that one time and then the next day again and then he spent the night and never left again because she’d rather have dick than the safety of her 3 year old. And of course when he was back we needed to go after a few days before she was talking about how we have a good starting ground here and that we don’t have to worry that he’s just “seeing his kid”(yeah seeing where he made his kid maybe). And when the three of us who were paying to live there started to to not be allowed to be in the kitchen when they were and weren’t allowed to smoke in the outdoor room when they were, we weren’t allowed to be anywhere accept in the dark basement in which we were renting, which had no windows and only one very small very leaky moldy bathroom, originally my other coworker/roommate was supposed to be able to use the main level bathroom due to the fact that she was renting a room on that floor, but they started stealing things until we all only used my bathroom. Because this man had come back into her life she hated us, I had been friends with this women for a year before even considering moving in with her and she was a close friend, it all changed so quickly I was quite hurt, and had to see her everywhere I was(since she was my boss). Did I forget to mention she had control of my job and where I lived, wow it seems pretty dumb of me when I type it out now, but that’s how much I trusted her she was like an older sister that I had never had, and she flipped that right over on me. Ever since the shit head she was banging came back we had been trying to find a place to move into because right after he came back she told us(in a fucking text)  that it wasn’t working out and we needed to find a new place to go as soon as we could. Well we are looking for a place for the three of us and my coworkers two cats(let me damn tell you finding housing in the state I live in isn’t easy unless you have a teller credit and rich parents), we searched and continued working where we were because we figured once we move it won’t be that bad to keep working her right? So a few months pass, we were still applying to places and trying to get out but it wasn’t going great. So let’s say it’s now mid to late May, we both go into work at the same time because my coworkers shift got switched and we car pooped a lot so we didn’t think about it because they scheduled us like that a lot. When we got in higher management is there and were like hmm must be because we have a new hire, nope it’s because that dumb bitch who already was ruining our lives everyday wanted to go further, so she tattled on us for something she was also doing. So we both get fired that day and just wait for my bf to get off to tell him the extent of what happened, fast forward to 11:30 pm that night we all get a group text about how horrible we are and that we have less than 3 days to be gone or our stuff and my coworkers pets will be destroyed( and yes now that it’s later and even like 5 days after this happened I realized we really should’ve called the cops, but we were also super scared at the time for our things animals). So I freak out like hard and start packing like no person has packed before I didn’t stop for over 13 hours until they told me I had to take a break and go place the reservation at the campground we were going to that night because I wasn’t staying there one more night and risking not getting out in time, and we couldn’t afford a hotel being newly jobless aside from one of us. So after getting the campsite we came back to pack more and wait for my bf to get back with a uhaul, the only one they had ended up being 26 feet long but really we ended up needing all that space from some god awful reason. It took us with 4 people from 6 pm untol 3 am to pack the uhaul, but when we finally got that damn thing packed it started pouring. So we got into the vehicles and headed to the campsite which we pitched our little tent in the rain and finally laid down around 5 am. Now if you thought this was enough hold on to you handbaskets. Together the three of us camped until a few weeks later when my now excoworkers tent with the cats in it flooded from a storm, everything but the mattress was fine, but they bailed anyway and went to stay with their mom and decided they were no longer going  to find a place a room with us. In turn really fucked us over since we had missed out on a few places we could’ve afforded to move to but didn’t try because they didn’t take cats or didn’t have two bedrooms. Personally we couldn’t avoided being kicked out in the first place by being able to just of moved way earlier on. Well in all that time we spent trying to find a place for all of us, the money we had saved dwindled, in with fucked us even more, so after they leave and stay with their mom they find a place with their bf after like a week(because he had a fancy job), and we continued being stuck camping until the 4th of July when there was nowhere left to camp anymore, so we did the last thing we could think of and asked his mom and her bf if we could stay with them for a little while so we could try and find somewhere more permanent, of course because he hadn’t been talking to her much after she kicked us out the first time she was overjoyed to have her son back under her roof, for like 2 weeks 😑. Then she lost it one day because we asked her where she had put my shoes because she had rearranged the living room in the middle of the night and now my only pair of shoes was missing. Let me just say just wanted my damn shoes and I got my shoes back but I yet again realized why you don’t always believe in people just because they are related to someone you love. Damn stupid bitch tired to just kick me out because she took my shoes, my bf looked at her like she was nuts and told her that he wasn’t leaving me so if I had to go he was going to, that made things worse, the whole time this poor man that had asked her to marry him even was trying to defuse her and make it so we could stay and not have no where to go again. That didn’t work either unfortunately, and yet again I was packing my things so someone else wouldn’t destroy them. As I’m packing she thinks screaming in my face when I haven’t even said a word to her the whole time this has been going on will make things even better, I won’t fight with her back so she slams the door in my face and then goes outside to scream at her downstairs neighbor(who already thinks she a wack job). We get all of our things out and we can’t take both cars because only one of us has a license(you see we had two cars at the time because the suspension on the one was destroying the tires within a week)but one of the cars we were borrowing from my father and the other was his, we were going to leave his and come back for it when we could but, his mother realized that and screamed about getting it towed that night after we left, so we said fuck it and I drove anyway(I know how to drive, I’ve been driving since I was 14, just don’t have the stupid ass test taken) and since I was panicking and trying to get out of their fast I side swiped her car, which I personally find hilarious(don’t kick me out twice in one year crazy bitch). We had no clue where to go or what we were going to do, so we pulled into the gas station at the beginning of the road and desided  we had to go to a hotel at least for the night because it was already starting to get dark and we had no other ideas or people to contact. So we get up the next day and I have a missed call from the guy who we had met earlier in the summer who ran an efficiency motel, who told us he’d call if he ever had an opening, so we felt like holy shit this is finally our chance. Yeah so we got in there and have stayed but I’m too far from anything to walk to a job so he’s been trying to support us the best he can I’ve told him I could get a night job but he doesn’t really want that, and now the men he’s been working for haven’t been giving him any hours so we haven’t eaten a meal in days and we can’t pay the phone bill and I’m two weeks we won’t have anywhere to go again, I’ve tried to better my life every chance I’ve gotten in the past year and now I’m really starting to feel like this life really might be terrible until I die and I wasn’t given another choice by the “higher powers” my life was set to make me suffer until my last sun rises. TLDR: I’ve been fucked over majorly my whole life, but this year has been exceptionally ridiculous, and I feel like shit.",1569629195.0,2

994,d9j8bw,I miss the 90's. (Australia),"The 90's had better music, more reliable technology, better piracy for video game consoles, enough technology to be useful without interfering with daily life, more work around, no meth amphetamine, people weren't so easily offended, smokes, booze and weed were cheaper and easier to get a hold of, demo discs in gaming magazines, you actually hung around with people to know what was going on with their lives, letters were still somewhat common, no forcing mobile apps on people, no fucking Facebook and Instagram.

995,d9dc8m,Skewed ideas of romance and love,"You know that show Friends? Yeah, Ross and Rachel and all those guys? Yeah that show. I love it. Minus that part where Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) is a total bitch. 

Just to be clear, I don't mean generally bitchy or anything like that. What I mean is that she was simply fucking around with Ross' feelings forever and their whole relationship is romanticized as some big Romeo and Juliet love sage through the stars. It's not. At all. I've watched the show a lot. Multiple times. And every single time I think to myself ""God she is the fucking worst."" 

Yeah yeah, I know. It's a TV show and it's been over for a while. I know and I don't care. My problem is that people romanticize clearly toxic behavior and put it on a pedestal and pretend it's amazing relationship material when it just is not.",1569464434.0,2
