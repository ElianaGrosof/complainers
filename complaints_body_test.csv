"Tomorrow I start my senior year of hs, however it’s come to my knowledge and quite possibly has been ignored by me for the last few years that I have no true friends. My mother who has made my life a living hell since I was about 14 acts like it never happened and my dad and stepmom give more positive attention other places than me. Just about the only good thing going on rn is my gf. Ik she cares and potentially loves me, however I’ve never been shown what it’s like to be truly loved and cared for so what do I know? Idk. I guess I’m just confused and upset that things don’t go how I want them. Hopefully by next week I’m out of this spell and I can finally be at peace again. Thanks."
"I can get shot between the eyes on a battlefield, I can hurl myself down a road in a metal death machine that kills more people than most things, I can live on my own and pay for my own apartment/house, yet I can’t vape, something that is without a shadow of a doubt harmless. You know how they came up with 21, a politician raised it to 19 from 18 during scare campaigns for cigarettes and alcohol, boosting their ratings. And then another politician raised it to 20 to help there ratings and etc... the reason why they raised it isn’t because it helps, its because they realized that parents of 19-21 year olds were worried about their kids doing these things so they knew that those people would vote for them if they raised it. And then for some reason they just transferred the vaping age from 18 straight to 21 because we have made 21 a buzzword for politicians. It has had a negative affect, people who were smokers that were 18-20 had a reason to switch to vaping instead of smoking because they could do it legally, but now they have one less reason to quit illegally buying cigarettes from the same source instead of having to find a new illegal source to get vaping supplies. It just makes me sad that most of our laws are created out of fear mongering to improve someones career. I say it should be one or the other, make the military 21+ to join or lower the vaping age (which will never happen people are too scared to leave their little safety bubble) ive been going to catholic school my whole life and I’m decently polite, my parents still think im an angel, wake up your child isn’t perfect, either roll with the punches and improve their capabilities or waste all your time and money trying to eliminate our faults that in the end can never be gone."
"Politics are of course a touchy subject but there 3 subs in particular on Reddit who have all banned me (quickly) without saying anything particularly nasty. The problem is that these reddits all have the same flaw, where they squash anyone that disagrees with them on a technicality. They are online echo chambers.

/r/Israel (I can understand stopping anti-semites but dare not criticize Israel)

/r/Iran (This is actually a regime change forum, I think the State Department/CIA is seeding it)

/r/AskAConservative (This one, by design, is a echo chamber. Fine but who mutes someone that emails the mod once, professionally and politely? The most thin skinned mod I've encountered)

Be careful what you read on Reddit and always keep in mind the Mod's on the other could be someone with an agenda."
this community isn't what it used to be. now the ads blast full frontal when you're just scrolling. im installing adblock.
"It started with me trying to play rainbow on xbox and I was playing with two random people I found off of a group post. Everything was going fine until we got in a game in which a random teammate was booting enemy team members which really makes me upset . I tell the dude that he should stop and that what he's doing is illegal but he just told me "" what are you gonna do cry yourself to sleep about it"", that already had me pissed off but then you add in my teammates backing up the booter that made me super upset. My teammates end up kicking me after we win the game(by cheating) and I decide to go to the unethical pro life tips subreddit to ask what I could do about it. In the post I tell the story and I say that it's a felony to boot people and that I want something to happen to them because it seems like they always get away with that. Fast forward 5 minutes and I have a couple of replies asking how it was a felony and I explained why it was, one guy told me that depending on my location it could or could not be a felony and i wrote back that whether it is or it isnt i still want something to happen because at the end of the day booting is wrong. Another person commented that I was getting on the subreddit to bitch about a game and my post was downvoted a lot, this is only my second time posting and that was my first time so it makes sense that I am using it wrong but I feel like nobody was paying attention to what I said and they played more attention to if booting is a felony, the point of the post was asking if I could do anything to the people that do this but it felt like nobody paid attention to that, i could report them to the FBI because what they are doing is serious but idk I'm just kinda let down right now. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk and if you read this whole thing please dont just tell me I'm stupid and that it's just a game."
"Y'all know what I really hate? When people crosspost on reddit, they have a tendency to (word for word) copy the title of the post they shared, despite the fact that you can see the title of both posts. Just, for Christ's sake, stop doing this. Ik I'm just being nitpicky but I cannot express in words how much I hate people doing this."
"A Storie of an awful night. (TRUE)


So the stars of the show are,

OP: Me (F,14)
BM: Bitchy Mom (F,43)
DD: Dumb Dad (M,44)
CS: Crazy Sister (F,11)
SD: My Service Dog (M,7) (I have Tourette’s Syndrome, it’s where in my case I have uncontrollable movement and speech.  For example I’ll just clap or punch the ground, that’s a motor tic.  Or maybe I’ll scream something.  That’s a vocal tic.  The Tourette’s effects me in a way so that I need a service dog.  Any other questions google will hopefully help you out.  If that doesn’t work I’m happy to help!)
OD: Other Dog (F,7)

BTW, I just wanna say I love my family very much and they love me.  I just need to let off some steam.

On with the story!

So, me and my family were eating dinner in are living room and watching a movie called Rudy. (It’s very good!  Watch it!)

While I was eating with my back against the couch, OD comes over and tries to eat my food.  I stop her with my legs so OD’s shoulders are stuck between my thighs.  I start moving my legs left to right to try and get OD to back out but OD’s persistent and just stays there while she goes side to side.

CS suddenly yells, “OMG!  Stop killing the dog!”.
I’m very confused cause I never expected CS to ever say that even though she is CS.  Also, dose it look like I’m killing OD?  No, OD’s neck isn’t stuck between my legs and she’s only being moved enough to get annoyed.

I say, “CS, OD’s fine calm down.”.

CS’s not convinced.

BM backs me up with, “Calm down CS, OP’s not hurting the dog.”

CS surrenders.  “Just get OD out of OP’s legs!”.

I get OD away from me and my dinner and CS calms down and we continue with the movie.  This didn’t really piss me off it was just surprised CS would think i’ed hurt OD.

Later in the movie, I stretch my arms up cause I’m getting tired and I accidentally nock the lamp shade off the lamp.

BM probably had a bad day I’m guessing cause of her reaction.

“OP THIS IS THE LAST FUCKING TIME TODAY!”  I haven’t been in the room all day, and haven’t touched that lamp.

BM goes for me, she try’s to grabbed me or hit me.  I block BM by grabbing her hand like we’re gonna arm wrestle.  BM try’s to get her hand out of my hand while yelling at me, standing over me, and putting half of her weight on me other half on the couch, other hand holding the lamp shade.

BM finally gets her hand out and gives me a weaker smack then what I was guessing she was gonna give.  “What’s next!  You going to break one of my aunts old mirrors like CS or one of her lamps like this one?!”  I haven’t Brocken any of BM’s aunt’s things yet, my sister did on accident though.  Didn’t even break this lamp.

I just leave the couch and sit with SD in a chair on the other side of the room.  Honestly, that was really uncalled for.

The last thing that happened was this.  CS forgot her phone in our basement and doesn’t like to go down there at night, lights on or off cause she’s scared The Ring Girl will crawl out off the T.V. and kill her.  She hasn’t even seen the movie.

So, I go down with CS and wait in the door way of the basement.  “OP just come inside with me please!”.  I go inside and wait, I’m still next to the door way pretty much in the same spot but this is good enough for her so CS goes on her quest to find her missing phone before the infamous Ring Girl gets her.

CS finds it in like 10 seconds and we leave the basement together.  So while going up the stairs I go to fast and she screams.  (Keep in mind right now it’s like 12AM and my parents are trying to sleep.  I also go way faster cause I’m 5’10” and like 75% legs.).

When we get to the top of the stairs DD storms out of his room and grabs me and hits my arm.  Then, the same to CS.

I am pissed off now.  DD only gets this mad when he has a reason too.  This was totally unexpected and he had no reason, nothing at all.  DD also rarely to almost never hits me or CS, ever.

I go up to him and say what’s on my mind, “You has absolutely no right to do that, I didn’t do anything and CS got spook once.  That was no reason to hit us at all!”  I could tell he really regrets what he did.  I walk past him, get SD and go to bed.

5 mins latter DD opens my door and apologized.
I forgave him cause he really meant it.

Thank you for reading this all the way!  Have a great day!"
Reddit is allowing people to post complete lies on a public forum and this cannot be removed. I am being lied about by a scammer renter.
"Now, there are 2 types of feminists, the good kind and the bad kind. The good kind is where they want equality for both genders, which is good and should happen. But by definition, it is someone who is active in feminism, so just because you support the good feminism, doesn’t mean you are a feminist. Moving on to the bad feminists. These feminists believe that all men are horrible and should either die, or see how it feels when they are “oppressed”. These ones are the following: Hypocrites, aggressive towards men, are assholes in general, and whenever a man is mad at them, they call them sexist and use that as an excuse for them being assholes. The last reason I said isn‘t just feminists but also any people that aren’t straight white males. If you don’t like a gay person because they were bullying a kid, they’ll call you homophobic. If you don’t like a black person for attempting to steal your package at the door, they’ll call you racist. They list goes on, but I just wanted to say, the bad feminists, they are annoying. And please stop. (note I don’t hate gay, black people, and women, I am irratated at the person not the race/sexuality."
" I was supposed to get three packages yesterday and they weren't delivered, YET online in the tracking updates it says DELIVERED. But it's impossible for me to have missed the items being delivered for several reasons.

First off, my mail man usually delivers the packages first and if he/she doesn't then they come back. Well, about 4 hours before the delivered time on the tracking I got my mail which meant the packages would come later. So guess what. I checked every 1/2 to 1 hr for the packages. NOTHING!

During the time that the tracking says the packages were delivered there was absolutely no video footage - I have a motion detector camera that records whenever ANYONE comes to the front door. And the tracking said IN/NEAR mailbox.

Secondly, during that time, my brother was actually outside on the porch, he wouldn't have missed packages being brought or set outside.

Thirdly, my sister came to visit my mom about 10 minutes after SAID DELIVERY TIME, she would have brought the packages inside or seen the mailman, NOTHING

Fourth, a few minutes after my sister had left, about 30 minutes after SAID DELIVERY TIME, I checked the mail box and around it, still NOTHING.

So there wasn't any way someone could steal them within the 4 hours before SAID DELIVERY TIME or up to 1 hour after SAID DELIVERY TIME.

I even checked about 4 HOURS after SAID DELIVERY TIME for packages around or In my mail box. NOTHING was delivered, therefore,

CONCLUSION = USPS MAIL MAN/WOMAN LIED ABOUT DELIVERY TIME OR STOLE MY PACKAGES."
